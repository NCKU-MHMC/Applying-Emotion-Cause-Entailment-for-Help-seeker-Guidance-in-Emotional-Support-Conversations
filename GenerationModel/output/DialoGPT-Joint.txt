I understand. I can feel you. I had a similar situation in the beginning of the year.
I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are in the right place right now.
What class was it? I am so sorry to hear that. I went through the same thing and it was so frustrating.
Have you tried contacting a school counsellor?
Have you spoken with any of the teachers at the school?
It sounds as though you have been having a difficult time. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy?
You should do that, you will get better.
If you choose the school you are currently enrolled in, the school will help you to learn more about the school.
You can always go to another college if you don't mind. I know how difficult it is but I think it's worth a try.
Have a great day! You as well! :)
Bye! Have a great day! You too!
Oh no! What is going on? Is he doing his job or is he not doing his work?
What are you doing to make this situation worse?
So you feel as though you have no right to be asking her to do that. Do you think she is making you feel this way?
Have you spoken to your co worker about this?
So you feel that the co worker is not allowing him to do what he wants? Is that correct?
I have been in HR, and have found that HR is very helpful and will help you get through this.
I am sure that would not be a good idea. You have a very hard time with this. It's hard to work with HR, especially if you are a manager.
I can understand that. Do you think that maybe HR can give you a raise?
How do you feel about the situation? Does it bother you that she has been bothering you?
How long have you been together? Have you tried to talk with them about how you feel?
Hi, what's going on? Can you tell me more about it?
That's a really tough situation to be in. What's going on?
What was the deal? Is this a big deal?
How long were you with the SOB? Did he try to steal money or was he just a friend?
It must be very difficult to not know what is going on, especially in a new job.
Is there any way you could explain to me how he did that?
I think that would be a good idea. I think that the only way you could possibly control your behaviour is if you are able to control your actions.
I think it might be a good idea. There are a lot more options out there.
I am doing great. How long have you been friends?
Hello! How are you today? I am doing great.
How are you doing today? Can you tell me a little about it?
I can understand why you are feeling badly, but I know that you are not alone.
So you feel that the customer would not like your work if you were laid off?
Is there anything that you would like to talk about?
Have you talked to your COVID supervisor about how you feel?
Have you talked to your manager about this? Sometimes it helps to talk to your boss about it and ask them if they would like to discuss any issues.
That is a great attitude. Have you tried contacting your local councilor to discuss this?
I am glad that I could help. I know that you are not alone in feeling this way.
Have you considered speaking with your manager about it? Maybe they can help you out with this?
It sounds like you are feeling a bit stressed out. Do you have anyone you can talk to to about this?
I am glad that I could be of some help.
Do you think you will be able to find a job within a few months?
That is very good. I think you will have a great future.
Wow. That is a positive attitude. I hope that you feel better soon.
I am proud that you are having a great year.
I think that you are a good person for doing something like this.
You are welcome! Bye! I am here to help you with anything else.
Hi! How are you? Can you tell me what is going on?
Have you tried to talk to your doctor about this?
I used to have the same problem with my sleeping pattern and tried different methods.
You can use different methods to reach out and take your mind off of it
What exercises did you use to relax and fall asleep?
Yes, I think it was a combination of many different strategies that I had used, but one of those was the exercise that helped me get more sleep. I was also a bit more active during the day.
Yeah I do that and have been able to work from home. I also have a laptop that works great for me, and I use that as a remote control for my phone.
Try doing exercise and taking a few deep breaths.
It is great that you are still doing these things!
It was great to get a little sleep. It helped me a lot.
Also, do you have a lot more energy in your body?
I'm doing okay. What seems to be the issue?
What kind of job do you have? I am sure you will find something.
What kind of work do you do? It is very difficult to find employment right now.
I understand. I would be prepared for anything to make me feel better. What are some of your hobbies?
I think that's a great idea. Do you think that maybe you could take up a career that you enjoy doing?
It's important to have hobbies that you enjoy. Do you have a favorite one?
Yes, you can try and start with a challenge and see what works for you.
That sounds like a great opportunity. Do you have a job search?
I would suggest looking into some of the new companies that are making the most money.
Yes, it would be a great idea. I think that's a very good idea.
There are some organisations that will provide you with temporary work, like Indeed.
That's true! I think it would be a great idea to be able to find work at home.
How are you doing today? Is there anything particular that you'd like to talk about?
I am sorry to hear that. What is making you sad?
Have you ever been in a relationship with her?
Do you think she may have been trying to help you? Sometimes it is better to be able to communicate with friends and family.
I've been there, and I can understand how you feel. I did that myself and it took a while for her to come around.
It sounds like you are having a lot of issues with your friends and family. Have there been any conversations about it?
I would not try to talk to anyone else.
I think you are right. It is not like you are getting a break but you are taking a step in the right direction.
I think that it would be best to give it a try.
No problem. I hope things work out for you.
Hi there! How are you doing today? I am doing great.
I'm sorry to hear that, I can understand how you feel. Do you have any plans in place for the future that might allow you to take a semester off?
Are you a student who has a lot of experience in economics?
I would suggest starting with a computer science course, and then you can work through the school year by year.
How long have you been studying? Have you ever tried to study online?
I understand that. You should be able to ask your advisor for advice. I think it would be helpful to have someone to talk to.
I'm glad I could help! Are there any other questions you have?
I hope I have been able to be of some help to you.
It sounds like you are ready to move on.
Thank you for talking! I wish you the best of luck!
I'm glad you're feeling more confident now. Take care and stay safe
What is causing you to be so upset? Is there any reason why you are upset?
What is it that you are having a hard time with?
I am really sorry to hear that. Covid19 has made it harder to move in to a new country. Is there anything you would like to talk about?
How are you today? Is there anything you want to talk about?
Are you able to walk outside to be able to reach out to people in the area who are close to the area.
Yes I work in a food delivery place and I'm working through a few things right now.
Are you having any trouble getting out of the house?
Are you feeling better? It sounds like you are feeling better.
I am glad I was able to help! It was a pleasure speaking with you.
Thank you for talking! I am glad you are feeling better.
How may I assist you today. Please tell me what is going on.
That's a good thing to hear, I'm sorry you're feeling disturbed. What are some of your concerns?
I can understand how you feel. Do you have any friends that you could talk to about this?
So you are in college and not feeling motivated to learn how to make money?
I was in college and I had to put in a study time as well. It was difficult to keep up with all the stress I had during that time.
What are some things you've struggled with during the past two years?
I am sure that you have the skills and qualifications to do the job you want to do, but it is difficult to get through.
Are you worried about your future job? I think that you should be worried about that.
Have you considered looking into some online courses? I know it's not always the easiest thing to do, but I think it would be helpful to have a tutor in your field to help you understand what to do in your career.
I have been in that position and i have been through that too. I am happy to help, but you need to work harder and take care of yourself
are you feeling depressed? Sometimes that can be a sign of depression.
when i was in a similar situation, i used to say that i just had to stay motivated to work, but i found it helped to think of ways to get out of that situation
How long have you been working? I've been in the same situation.
Wow. I can imagine how stressful that must have been for you.
I went to college for a while, but then I realized I could make a lot of money, and that I could do it without hurting myself.
You are not alone. I have had to quit my job because I was a well off worker.
I am not sure how that would work but I am willing to give it a shot.
I see. I am in the same boat and i also have been working for my degree.
That sounds like a great plan. I am sure you will find a way to make it through this!
Good, it is a great opportunity to gain knowledge about the job.
I can see how you feel. I feel like you have to take the big step of not being a veteran
Hello there. How are you doing today? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?
What is making you sad? Can you tell me more?
Do you have a lot of spare time to do your own work?
Is there anything specific that you find difficult? Or are you just making a habit of working hard to get yourself out of bed?
Yes, that is a great idea. I also think that exercise can increase your energy levels.
What type of work are you in? Is it for food or for leisure?
I am sorry to hear that. Do you think that would be the case if he were to get diagnosed with Covid?
Have you considered a virtual world where you can visit other people and see how you feel?
There are a lot more options out there for you than just exercise!
I think you need to open up to your family and friends that you care about.
You're welcome. Have a good day! I hope you have a good rest of your day!
I wish you the best. You too! Have a great day!
Hello, how are you? How can I help you?
What is the issue? What is the problem?
Have you talked to your friends about this? Or maybe you can speak to your friend about it?
I understand that. Sometimes, we need to take a step back and realize that we have to take steps to make things better
I can understand that you are upset because she has blocked you, but why do you think she is the one that is upset about it?
I can understand that, I would not let her win the friendship
That's a great idea! Give her some time to reflect and do her best
I am sorry you feel that way, but you can do it
I can understand how you feel, it was a mistake to make
I think that you should try to get her to help you
I can tell you are a very selfish person and will not change.
I would suggest to try to make yourself more comfortable in your situation and have a good conversation
Have you tried reaching out to her on facebook and chatting with her about it?
You are welcome, I hope you can get through this
You too! I hope things work out for you
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure it is very difficult to cope with loss. Do you feel as though you are losing your job because of this?
Why did you lose your job? I lost mine in 2008.
What kind of work do you do? Do you have a family member?
Do you have an opportunity to talk to your boss about it?
You can do it! I believe in you.
You are welcome. I am glad I could help.
Yes I do. I also find it helpful to ask for advice or suggestions on how to make new jobs and how to get them
I wish you all the luck in the world.
I know that it is hard to find employment but it is very possible.
No problem! I hope that I was able to be of some help and that you will feel better.
You too! I wish you the best! Have a good rest of day. Stay safe.
You are welcome. Have an awesome rest of day!
It's okay, I understand. You can press quit and take the survey. I can't help you now.
I would like a thank you to you as well.
Hello, how are you doing today? Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
I can see your upper box and it has a lot of text, so I can understand why you are feeling that way.
Can you tell me more about the problem? What is causing the problem, is it a known issue with your connection?
I can see that your situation is very difficult. What do you think you can do to support your family?
I understand that it is hard for everyone. However, I have found that if you can look for a new job, you can find something that you enjoy doing.
I would suggest looking for another job if you are so concerned about the situation, or if you feel that you are unable to pay your bills right now, you should seek another job.
It is a tough time, but you can get through this!
That sounds like a great idea! Have you considered looking for another job to provide you with a good pay check?
It sounds like you have a great plan in place, and I am sure they will come around for you.
I'm glad to hear it! I hope that I have been able to be of some help.
That sounds like an excellent idea! I hope it helps!
Of course! I'm glad I could help!
I'm sorry to hear that, what is bothering you?
What do you think is the cause of your tiredness?
I understand. I also have been in a similar situation. I'm a little worried about how much time I spend at home when I'm feeling tired. It's been a rough year, but I'm sure it will get better.
I have had similar issues and I have found that eating well can help with that.
Have you thought about changing your circadian rhythm? Sometimes circadian rhythm changes can be helpful.
That sounds like a good idea! I have found that if I put my time into it, I actually increase my sleep capacity!
A lot of people are having the same problem with getting up early in morning, I am not sure why but it seems to have helped me a lot.
Do you feel exhausted after a day of work?
You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself. I can tell that you have a great outlook on things.
Have you tried any methods that may help with your sleep problems?
It sounds like you are feeling stressed and stressed, do you think that it is possible to take a few deep breaths and let go of the stress?
Do you like to do any sort of exercise?
Yes, I sleep in a dark room so it doesn't bother me.
You are welcome! Enjoy the rest of your day!
It is a very tough time for everyone. It is definitely not easy to stay awake.
you as well! I'm glad you are feeling better!
What is going on? I am sorry to hear that. What is causing you to feel depressed?
Have you been able to talk to your close friend?
What has made you feel that way, is it something specific?
Have you tried to talk to him about it?
I can understand how you feel. I lost a friend in 2013 and I can understand your feelings.
Have you tried to talk to your close friend about how you're coping?
What do you think you are doing to try to make him sleep?
I can understand that. Sometimes when you feel scared you can't stop him from talking to you.
That can be a symptom of depression, not just loss of memory.
I can understand that. Maybe you can try to do some small exercises to help you sleep better.
It's a very hard situation to be in, but I think it's worth a try.
Good! I hope things work out for you. I'm glad I could be of help.
Hi, how are you doing today? I am doing great.
I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of tests do you have?
Have you tried to look into online courses that may help you prepare for the exam?
So you feel that you can't do your best?
Is that something that you are worried about? I am in school right now and I am not worried about anything.
It's great that you're doing so well at school! I'm really glad you're able to do this! What field are you studying in?
Well, if you can't find a way to get on your probation then I would suggest that you should stay on your academic probation until you can find a good way to graduate.
Well, I think you should take it slow and relax. You'll be fine.
I am sure that you will find a way to make it through this!
There are plenty of online courses that help you learn how to prepare for the exams. It's the best place to start.
That is very true. I have also been struggling with taking online classes as well. I think that it would be best to take those classes and start learning them as soon as possible.
I think you are definitely on the right track! I am proud of you for taking the time to do it!
Hi. How are you today? I am doing okay.
I understand. I am also in a similar situation. What is your most recent change?
Have you tried looking into any other ways to help your weight?
I would suggest taking a walk to the park and eat healthy. I know it is hard but i know you can get through this.
Have you tried getting professional help? Sometimes it helps to give some advice to someone who is close to you.
I understand. You need to get some food that you like and your body can handle it, even though it is unhealthy.
You can also try to go to a local food bank and ask for a loan out for free if you feel that you can afford it.
Yes. I was able to provide a free meal to my children and they were very generous.
Yes, i am in COVID and I have found it difficult to take my kids out during the pand pandemic.
You should talk to your doctor about it. It sounds like you are very concerned about it and you should be able to tell him.
You sound like a really good person and a great mom.
Hello, how are you doing today? What is on your mind?
I understand. What's making you feel stressed about the situation?
how has covid been affecting you? are you having a lot more issues with covid?
Do you feel that you are being treated unfairly by the government?
What are your feelings towards Biden? Do you feel that Biden's presidency has been overrated for many people?
I can understand how you feel. I used to be a Biden supporter. I now know it doesn t really matter what you think about Biden but I can tell you are feeling a lot better now.
that is a good thing to know, and sometimes it is important to learn from your friend to not push your emotions too much.
she probably felt the same way when Biden won.
do you feel like you have a chance to talk to her about how you feel?
so you feel like you have a connection to her and she has been friends for a very long time
Of course! I'm glad I could be of some help.
bye. I hope I was able to be of some help.
Hello. How are you doing today? Is there anything bothering you?
I am so sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends you can talk to about this?
Have you talked to him about it? If not, what is causing the stress?
What makes you feel this way? I am sorry to see that, are you having issues with your ex?
I can understand how frustrating that must feel. I know how you feel. It's been a rough time for everyone.
I can understand how difficult this is for you. I know it's hard, but you can do it! It sounds like you're really determined to stay strong and keep your head up!
I can understand how frustrating that must have been. I know you can do it!
I can try to talk to you about your problems. You are right to think that.
What are some of your feelings? I would suggest starting a new hobby or something that you can explore.
I hope that you will be able to find a solution.
You are welcome. Have a good day! :)
You have to take it one day at a time.
How can I help you today? What is it that you are having trouble with?
So you feel like you are struggling with it?
Are you feeling frustrated that you can't start your work?
Have you tried going into your work profile and applying for a position?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried any other work?
I think that if you're able to start with a journal, you might be able access to a lot of information that might help you.
You should definitely try it. I think it would help you!
I am sorry to hear that. I'm sure it will be a difficult time for you, but I know that you can get through it!
Maybe you could start by telling your parents that you don t want them to know that you're a mom?
I can understand that. But it's worth a try!
You're welcome! If you need anything else, I'm glad I could help!
Well, if you press quit I can't see your end so I can only end it.
Sure! I hope you feel better! Have a wonderful day.
Hello there, how are you? I am okay.
Is there any reason why you feel this way?
Have you tried to talk to her about it?
What about after the break up? Did she have a good relationship with you?
Wow, that's really hard. I know you can do it!
Yes, it is hard to see someone go through that.
What do you feel is contributing to your depression?
I'm sure it will all work out in the end.
What are some of your hobbies? I love to listen to music, or play video games.
I think that it would be great that you are able to connect with people in your community.
You're very welcome. I wish you all the best with your healing and your family.
What do you think would be an appropriate place to start?
If you can get a new one, you can always get a second opinion.
I'm not sure. I know you can get through this.
I am so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be, especially with the time we are going through.
Thats good, your sister and your brother should be ready to be ready for a new boyfriend
Thank you. I hope you feel better soon.
Hi, how are you doing today? I am doing well, just getting through this tough time.
Why are you feeling depressed? I am sorry to hear that.
what sort of work do you do? it is hard to find a job when you are not good enough to finish.
what have you been studying for? i have been in depression and i can understand that
if you are confident you will get your work done.
you need to have more confidence in yourself to be successful then you can get in a online class
yes i am sure you will do fine, i think you will be able to do well.
i think it's very good for you to get your work done in one sitting. I think you can do it.
do you have friends or family that you could borrow money from?
you are welcome i hope i can help with some help
you are welcome. i hope you have a good day.
you need to end the chat so i can end the conversation
Hello, how are you today? Do you have a problem with your daily routine?
How are you? Are you doing okay? Is there anything that you'd like to talk about?
Do you feel that you are being overwhelmed by a test or a test you have not done?
What kind of problems are you facing? I am really sorry to hear that. I had to do some school work and I can understand how stressful that must be.
I understand that, I had to take my A level in college and it was really hard. I was worried I wouldn't be able to do well at all.
Well, I am really glad I could help you! It sounds like you are really concerned about your grades, and you have been doing a great job communicating your feelings to me!
I am really sorry to hear that. Have you tried taking a break from school for a while?
What are some things you would like to discuss?
Yes, it does. There's a group that meets at night at the library.
So you are not getting any help from your friends. It is always good to try and get some help from others.
I think you have a great plan! I would definitely recommend taking a class or taking it online to build your confidence.
I believe in you! I believe in yourself!
You too! God bless you. God bless the whole world!
how are you? how can i help you?
How long has this been going on? I am so sorry to hear that.
I think you should take your time and study for the exam!
I had a similar situation. I also studied a lot but I never studied at all. I was working on a plan for myself and then I found out that I wasn't doing enough because I was doing too much.
So you're feeling stressed about things you can't do?
I am a recovering alcoholic so it's definitely not easy. I take a lot more of time than I would like.
Is there anything else you would like to talk about?
I can tell that you have a lot of anxiety and have a very difficult time concentrating.
So you feel that you have to take a deep breath every day to relax?
I think it's great that you have someone to talk to. I know it's difficult, but you're doing great!
I hope you have a great day and feel better soon!
How are things going for you today? Do you have family there?
Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
What is stopping you from going out? Is there something that you are worried about?
Do you have any hobbies? I love to spend time playing video games and working out.
I've been there too. It's been hard to go to the movies.
Is there any way to get your family involved in this?
Have you tried going out to watch some movies or something to relax?
Do you have family or friends close by that can help you with the stress? Or just a friend?
Have you ever considered talking to your friends about your situation?
Have you talked to your parents about this? They might be able to help with some of the stress. It sounds like your parents are supportive.
You too! I hope things go well with you!
Yes I'm with my parents. It's been nice talking to you!
I'm here to listen and be helpful. I hope that everything works out for you and that you can be more careful.
I'm glad you're feeling better. And you're close to your friends.
What is the problem you are having? I am so sorry I can't help you
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. What is making you feel that way?
What sort of work are you looking for? I know you have a lot of experience, so you would be interested in helping others.
How long have you had this job? I'm in the same situation, but I understand your frustration and it is hard to find something that you love so much.
I am sure that there is a lot of government assistance out there.
Do you think you could possibly get in touch with the government? I think it would be a good idea to do that.
Have you considered going on a counselling session? There are a few organisations that might be able, maybe you could talk to them about it.
Yes, I think it would help to take some time to look for a job.
It sounds like you have a lot of money and are struggling to find a job. Do they offer any sort of support?
I am very happy to help you and I hope that I have helped you a little.
Do you have any other family members who may be able help with this?
You are welcome. I am happy to help you with any and all your needs.
Of course, I wish all the very best for the future
Thank you! Good luck! :D You need any other questions?
And you too! :)! Bye :) I hope you get some help from the other side of the world :)
I understand. I understand how you feel. I've had a hard time with coronavi as well. I don't feel like I'm doing it now.
Have you been able to go to the doctor?
How long have you been in the hospital? I've been in a hospital for over a year now and I've had it happen before. I'm so sorry.
I have a few friends who have had the vaccine and they are very concerned about it. I think that is something that could be worked on.
That's very understandable. You might also have to wait until the vaccine is delivered and if not, it may not be the vaccine you need to get in the first place. It might take some time before you can start feeling comfortable with it and then the vaccine might not be ready until 2021.
I am glad to hear that! I am sure you will find the motivation to do your best and help your family.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I think it is a great idea. It is a lot easier to deal with than it sounds.
I think you are doing a great job communicating your thoughts and feelings with others. It is important that you do not let this anxiety affect you.
It sounds like you have a lot of unresolved conflicts with people. Do you have any plans of getting some counseling or other forms of therapy?
I think it would help if you could tell me a little more about this situation.
It's okay to feel stressed about things, but you can control your fear and ignore it.
Yeah I think that's a great idea, it would make it easier to work on yourself and it will help to take care that you are feeling better.
Yes, there are a few of them - I know for a fact that there are groups out here that have been helping people to deal with anxiety and fear. It's a great way to communicate and understand.
You are right. It is scary but you can start to feel your true power
No problem. You are welcome. Have a good night!
Hi there, how are you doing today? I am doing well, thank you for asking!
What would you like to talk about? Is there anything you'd like to discuss?
I'm sorry to hear you're worried about her. Is there something specific that you'd like to talk to her about?
How long has this been going on? Is this the first time this has happened to you? I'm sorry that you're going through this.
I'm so happy for you. I'm sure you will do great.
Well, you can always try to reach out to her friends and family to help her out.
I'm glad that you are able to connect with her again. You can do it!
It's been a pleasure talking to you too.
I am very glad you are feeling better. I hope you have a great day.
Merry Christmas to you too! Bye! :D
You as well! Merry Christmas to you too!
Of course! Merry Christmas to you too! I hope you have a great Christmas! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
What seems to be the problem? I can't seem to find any solutions for you.
What happened? What is making you feel this way?
Have you spoken to your boyfriend about this? I have been in a similar situation and have found that if you talk to your girlfriend about it, you will find that you have a lot of support in your life that you can use for your relationship.
So you feel that you are not feeling as though you are being cheated on? Have you spoken to your boyfriend about this?
That is horrible. Have you tried talking to her about it?
I know it can be hard at times, but I know you can get through this!
It sounds like you are really going to do a great job with your life and it is great that you can get through this.
I'm glad I was able to help you!
I'm glad I could help, I hope things get better for you!
What do you mean? Is it because of covid?
do you have a good connection with your school?
Do you live alone? I found that it was a better learning experience for me.
I can understand that, I have been in that situation too. I was in a similar situation when I was starting a new course but I took the plunge and studied a lot, and then it all went back to normal
I think that you should have a plan in place to deal with your anxiety. It will help you to get through this!
Do you think you will be able to do well in your studies if you don't get your degree?
I think that's a good idea. You could also try to get an online course for free, which might help.
That sounds like a good idea. There is no reason you wouldn't be able to do that. You could always just use Zoom to connect to a Zoom group to learn a new way to study.
that is a tough situation to be in, but i think you can do it!
you too, good night and good luck! I hope you get a job soon.

What makes you feel ashamed of that? It is important to remember that you have a right to feel this way.
Do you think you can get food from the foodbanks or do you think that the food banks will have some kind of support for you?
That is a very difficult situation to be in. What do you think your work will look like?
I think that is a great idea! You should definitely reach out to other agencies as well!

You are very welcome. You are very strong.

You could also do a Christmas tree that would look like a Christmas Christmas tree.
You should definitely get some ideas of crafts that you enjoy that you could use to make presents for your children.
It is definitely fun to make Christmas presents for kids.
That sounds fun! I love painting things and doing them myself.

So you are a woman with children, and your friend picked a fight with you for no reasons?

It sounds as though you are having a hard time dealing with this, and are you aware that you are dealing with a bully?

I have a guitar that i put on at home.

Yes, I think that it would. That's a great idea!
I hope you have an amazing day. Have a great day!
Thank you for talking! Have a good day!
How are you doing today? How are you feeling?
I can understand that, I am also a woman and I know it is hard.
Why do you think she dumped you? Did she want to get back with you? Or did she not want to be with you.
Do you think you will find something you like more when you go out?
Have you considered moving on from her? Perhaps it would help you get some closure on your relationship.
It is very easy to give up after a break up. You have time to figure things out.
I have been in that situation. It was hard for me to give myself a chance, but it helped to know that I wasn't alone.
It sounds like you are a really nice person and you are making progress in reaching out for help.
I'm sure it will. I think you will find that the only thing that will change is that you will be better. We all have to go through this.

I'm glad I could help! I hope you have a wonderful day.
I would suggest talking to your doctor and see if they can give you some guidance on how to take care of your children. That will help you to get through this.
It is important to know that your son is capable of doing things that he loves.
I am sure you will be fine. We will all be through this together.
I think you are doing the right thing and I am glad you are feeling better.
I know you can do it! I hope you can get back into the mindset of your child's and healthy.
Hello! How are you doing today? I am doing well, thanks for asking!
What's going on? Is it your job?
I'm sorry to hear that. What's going through your mind?
So you are feeling as though you are in a difficult time and that you are not prepared to face all the stress that comes with it. Do you have any family members that would be willing to help?
Are you able to access social media? That can help you in the long run.
Have you thought about getting a support system that might be able to help you through this difficult time?
I've been in Covid so I know how rough it is for you. Covid has been a very hard year for all of us.
If you have the opportunity, you should do it! You are a wonderful person and you deserve it.
That's great! So you are not far away at all?
I'm glad I could help! It's been a pleasure chatting with you.
What do you mean? Is there a reason for that?
Do you have any friends that you could talk to about how you feel?
Maybe they should give you a list of people you can talk to and see what you are missing. Maybe you could make a list for them. I would suggest a list with the people you are close to.
Perhaps you could try going for walks and taking a walk in the park. Maybe you could connect with people who you care about and see if they are connected.
Yes, that is a valid point. I think it would be better if you let them know that you really love them. Maybe they will feel that you are trying to connect with them and you would like to see them more than they would.
I think that's true. But just from chatting with you, I can tell you that you are really passionate about the subject.
It is true, I have been in situations where I feel the need to ask people if they are interested and they tell me if they have common interest.
That is a great idea! I am glad you are feeling better. I hope I have been able to help you today.
You are welcome! It is my pleasure. You can join anytime you like.
You could start with a club where you meet new people who you like and have a strong friendship.
Have you thought about joining a club to meet people who are close to you?
I hope that you are able to find some sort of club that you like and join.
I hope I have been able to be of some help!
You are welcome! You seem like a great person. I wish you the best!

What is the college? I am also in college
what is the problem? what is the goal?
Do you have any student loans or grants? There are lots of ways to help with that, such as a student loan from a private school, or student loan to a private college.
What kind of loans are you looking for? Are you looking at a lot of options?
What would be the reason you would be hesitant?
I can see how that would be difficult. Have you talked with your advisor?
I think that you should be able to make payments through your school account and see what they say
you can have a doctor review it and see what you need
I understand that. I had a form that required a form for a test
that is great that you are pursuing a religious studies degree
maybe you could see your doctor and see what they say
okay. I hope that helps. It sounds like you are feeling very accomplished and able to make it through this
or maybe your school can provide a scholarship program for free
what do you mean? i can see that you are trying to make it through this
you as well! Merry Christmas to you as well

how long has this been going on? have you been together?
I understand how you feel. I have been through a similar situation. I know its tough but I know it will get better
do you have any friends you can talk to about this
thats the spirit, you will get through this
don't think about it, just do it.
i can tell you are really stressed out about this and it's really hard to get over it
or maybe just give her some time to adjust to the new surroundings
well i hope you find the correct girl and you will find the perfect girl
I'm doing okay, how can I help you today?
I'm sorry to hear that. I've had a similar situation in the past and I can tell you have a lot going on.
Have you considered having a job interview? Or possibly meeting with a friend?
Are you aware of any other issues that you are having?
So it sounds like your employer has not been receptive to your concerns and you are worried about your job security?
Have you considered contacting your local government department to discuss how to handle this situation?
It sounds as though you are worried about your job and your mental health. Do you think that would be a good first step?
That is an incredibly difficult situation to be in, and you are not alone in feeling that way. Do you think you are being treated unfairly?
That's great. Do you feel that you have to ask for time off to work? I think that would be a good way to keep your head up!
Do you have any family or friends who might be able to help?
You're welcome! I hope that things go well for you!
Well I hope that I was able to be of some help to you. It sounds like you are really trying hard to stay positive and do everything you can to get through this.
I'm not sure, I think it would be more than accommodating.
Do you think you could try to get some counselling for the situation?
I hope that I have been able to be of some help to you. I know it's hard right now, but I hope things get better for you!
I am glad I could help! Have a wonderful day!
Do you have any pets? I am in the UK and my pet has been around for quite a long time. I have an indoor outdoor cat that has been trained to be indoor.

Well, you can just tell me if you have any questions
That's great to hear! I hope you are feeling better!
And you too! It's always nice to talk and to people.
I think you have to press quit and take the survey
Hello there! How are you doing today? I am doing well.
What's going on? What is going on with you?
so you feel like you have been failing your friends?
are you talking about the other person? that may be the reason you are upset.
what do you mean by that? I am not sure what you mean?
that's not a problem at all, you can't control them, you have to let them know you are not being honest with them and that you are being honest, they won't do that, they can't do it themselves
that sounds like a really difficult situation to be in.
i think you should be able to talk to them, but i suggest you try and talk to your friends.
yes i believe that you can do it, the first step is to be patient with them and try to move forward.
exactly. they are probably just frustrated that you have to go through this. i have also noticed that many of my friends who are in this situation have gone through similar situations and it is not something new
you too! I hope you will reach out again soon.
bye. I hope that you can make a good decision and it will all be over soon
Hello, how are you? I am doing well.
hello, how are you? what is the issue?
is there anything you'd like to talk about?
what's on your mind? are you doing anything worthwhile to do?
have you tried meditation? It seems to help me relax and feel better.
i understand. it's tough to be so invested in something that is not your fault.
you can also try to talk to friends or family about your problems. that will help with your feelings.
what would you like to talk about? perhaps you could suggest a way to express your feelings with your family?
yes. deep breaths can also help. you can also use them to clear your head and clear your mind.
yes, that is good. you will be a better person.
your welcome. i hope you have a wonderful day.
you too! bye. i hope you have a good day!
I am sorry to hear that. I'm sure you will do great. What grade did you get?
What grade were you on the paper? I am a student and can tell you are feeling very bad.
What grade are you in? I can understand how you are feeling.
Are you taking any classes that have been offered?
What grade are you on the paper? Is there anything else I can help you with?
Yes I agree with you on that. I've been there too, but I found it very easy to just ignore the grades I was given.
What grade are you in? I am a freshman and I have had to retake my paper for a while because of the grade I was in.
Well I think you can do it! Just don't make it a big deal.
I am glad I could help! I wish you all the best!
you're welcome. I hope you feel better!
You're welcome! I hope you have a great day!
you too! i am glad i could help you!
you too! you need to end the conversation and take the survey :)
I am sorry to hear that. Is there anything you'd love to talk about? I can help you in that regard.
I understand how that can be stressful. I am sure you are feeling a little bit anxious right now.
So you are not sure if you are able to find a job because of the pandemic?
What field are you in? I see that there are a lot of companies that offer support for their employees. What sort of work did you do?
That's great! I hope you have a great day.
It sounds like you are trying to make the best of the situation. Perhaps you could see some of the things that may have helped.
I think that it would be helpful to have more information. Do you have family in your family?
I can understand that. You need to be aware of the market. I know it will be hard but I know you can do it.
I can understand how you are feeling. You are a busy person, and it is a problem to be on the other side.
Perhaps there are some organizations that may be able to help you out with this?
I am a bit hesitant to say no. I know it's hard to find job right now. But I believe that you will find a good job.
I think you will be able to find work in your area. There are a lot of online resources that will help with finding work.
Yes, I believe that it will take time to process everything. I am sure that your feelings will be heard.
You're welcome. I hope that I've been able to be of some help. Have a good night.

I am good, thank you for asking. Is there anything I can help you with?
Is there something you'd like to talk about?
How long have you been working as a temp for your company?
So you feel that you are not being treated as though you are being treated unfairly?
It's really hard to get into an argument over something that doesn't really matter.
What do you think that might be? Maybe you could ask your boss to give you an example of how you are feeling?
You should try to keep your head up! I think you are doing your best!
I think it would be best to talk to the company's HR department, and let them know how you feel.
I am happy to share with you. Have a wonderful day.
Thank you. You as well! Have a great day.
Hi there, how are you doing today? What is on your mind?
How are you today? How are you doing?
What seems to be the problem? What's wrong?
What happened? What made you fear of it?
So you are feeling that you will lose your job?
Have you been able to talk to your co-workers?
You should also speak to your supervisor if you feel that you are losing your job.
Are you feeling anxious about losing your job? I know that can be very stressful, but I think you can make a difference.
Do you have any other hobbies? I personally like to play video games or watch movies.
It is good to hear that you are able to continue to work from home.
You are very welcome! I hope you feel better!
Yes of course! I hope you have a great day!

Absolutely! I love to play games with my friends.
About to come to terms with the job market?
Is there anything else you would like to talk about?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you feel as though you are being treated unfairly?
Do you have any friends that you can talk to about this?
I understand how you feel. I've had professors who didn't give me any reason to trust my professors. I was really disappointed when they did not give me an explanation of how I was feeling.
I hope you can get through this! It is a really hard time right now, but I believe you can make it through this and not let it get to you.
I think that you should have a conversation with them and let them know you feel that you can succeed and succeed. If they don t listen to you then you will feel as though you are failing.
I think it might be worthwhile to try to talk to your professor about this. Have they given you any reason why you feel this way?
I know that when my kids are struggling, it's very difficult for them to understand the support they need. Have they tried talking to your parents about this?
I think it would be a good start. I think it is very important to give the people who are struggling with the situation time to reflect on this.
Have you considered that maybe you could join a group that is more supportive of you and might be able to help you with your situation.
I'm glad that I was able to be of some help to you.

I understand that, I know it can be very hard to talk to your colleagues.
So you are worried about the potential of a virus to cause the pandemic? Do you feel like you are being held back by the virus?
I'm sorry. Do you have any other concerns?
I know that you are anxious, but you have to let it out, even when it is needed to calm down, and keep your mind off things.
I have felt that I have been able to be more comfortable with mask wearing since I began to wear them. It's difficult to find a safe place to be but I think you can overcome it.

Do you have any friends that you can talk to about your feelings?
You have to be strong, he is strong.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried talking to him about it? Sometimes it helps to talk to people in the same situation.
Sometimes it helps to try and focus on yourself.
I think that if you make a connection with him, you can see him more clearly and not feel sad.
I can understand how frustrating that is. But I think you can try to find a new friend and talk to him. There is no need to be angry or upset.
I think you can do it! I think you will find something to do after this.
Definitely! Do you think he would have a problem with you if you didn't have a better relationship?
Make a list of things you can do to make him feel better, and you will get him.
You're welcome! I hope you have a wonderful day!
That's great! It's really easy to get frustrated sometimes!
Hello there, how are you? I am doing well.
I am sorry to hear that. What is going on?
How long has this been going on? Have you talked to her in any way to help you feel better?
Is there anything else you would like to talk about?
If she has a problem with her being receptive to your opinion, then maybe you should ask her to share her feelings with you. That way she can be a better friend. Or maybe even a better therapist.
I would suggest talking to her if she is not receptive to you.
Try not to worry too much about it. You have a lot of experience in this field.
Youre not being mean to her. I would say that you are acting like a friend and she is not behaving this way.
You don't have to talk with her right away, just try to get to know her and make sure you can be there for her and give her the best wishes.
That sounds like an excellent plan. Youre not alone in thinking that. I know it can be frustrating.
That's good to hear. I know it's hard to see someone in that way. I wish you all the best for the future.
That's great! I hope you feel a little better.
Of course! I'm glad I could be of some help.
You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself and your relationship.
Hi there. How are you feeling today? Is there anything particular that you are feeling?
so you feel you have been feeling down and don't feel like you have friends to talk with?
can you tell me more about what's going on?
have you tried contacting your friends about it and trying to figure out what you can do to make your friends feel better?
i am sorry to see that, i understand your situation, you are doing your best, i hope you find a way to make friends again
I understand how you feel, I had a similar situation and it really took a toll on me.
yes, i know what you mean. you have a lot of support groups around you and it helps you to know where to go.
it sounds like you are trying to stay positive and stay positive, i am sure you will be doing just fine.
you sound like you have a good heart and are not afraid to get it.
that sounds like a great idea, i am sure that you will be able to find someone that will love you unconditionally and you will feel better about yourself.
i know that, but you should do it and be positive. you have a right to feel upset.
i am sorry to hear that. did you have a good relationship with your fiance?
it sounds like your fiance and your fiance have a good relationship and are also close to each other.
you can also talk to a close friend who is close to you and share your feelings with her.
i think its important that you have someone that you can talk to, even if you don't know him. i have been there myself.
you too! :) hope you feel better soon.
Hi! How are you doing today? Is there anything on your mind?
What is going on? I am sorry to hear that.
What are your major and field of work? Is it related to your degree or your field of study?
It sounds like you are feeling very isolated and are struggling with this. Are you able to talk to your co-worker about this?
I can understand that, and it is a terrible situation to have, but you can do it!
It is your fault not mine. I hope that I have been able to help you out a little
You sound like a great person. I wish you all the very best.
It sounds like you are trying to get help from your local board of teachers and have them explain to you what the issue is with the situation and what it is that they are trying so hard to get?
It sounds like you are very good at finding ways to help people. Have you tried reaching out to your county board to see if they can help with some other things?
I am sure that you will be fine. You can always try and get yourself in touch with them
Do you have any family members you can talk to about this?
It's really good that you're putting your trust in the people around you, especially if you're not a supervisor.
Have you considered joining a group of your peers to help your peers?
You can always reach out and share your progress with your colleagues.
No problem, I hope it helps. Take care
You too! Take care. Enjoy your day!
How are you? I am doing well. How can I help you today?
How are you feeling today? Are you feeling any differently today?
What do you think might be the reason? It sounds like you're feeling self loathing and self doubt?
How long has this been going on? Have you ever felt like this before?
Have you thought about making a list of things you've accomplished to reflect on the past few years?
I used to feel the same about my own life too. I also had depression from my life and it was very hard to move on and move on.
I used to think that too. I found it really helped to work out what was wrong with myself.
I see. So you are not sure what the next steps of life will be?
It sounds like you are treating yourself poorly by not being as normal as you would like.
Have you considered reaching out to friends and family who are affected by this?
Do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing?
You're very welcome. I hope things get better for you.
That's great to hear. I hope you have a great day!
I think you should try to take a course in mental health, it is a great course for a counsellor
So you're a professional and you're going to try to do everything you can to get a career changing?
I see. Would you be interested in joining a group for these types of training?
Can you please press quit and take the survey?
You as well! Merry Christmas! And you too!
Okay. Thank you! I hope you have a wonderful day!
How long have you been friends? I can understand why you are feeling that way.
Why do you hate them? I am also a big fan of your friend and I know how you are feeling.
How long have you been friends? Does he see the lie?
How do you feel about that lie? Did it hurt you personally?
What was the lie? Did he tell you what it was?
Is this the first time you have lied to your friends about what you have done?
What is the lie? I am not sure.
Have you tried speaking to your friends about how you feel?
What are your concerns with your boss? What specifically is the issue?
If HR has been strict on HR issues, it's best to just keep trying, but be firm. HR is very strict on how it's done, but I think you could be able to get it through!
Perhaps it's a bad idea to talk to your HR about it, since you're not sure how to handle it.
That sounds like a great first step. Do you think you could possibly have a conversation with her and see if you can resolve the situation?
Yes, that is a great idea. I think it would be a great first step to help her.
That's great, I think that would be a good idea.
Yes, I think it's important to recognize that you're not the only one who needs to be with this boss.
That's great. I hope that this will be a successful year for you.
You're welcome. I hope that I have been able to be of some help to you.
I'm glad I could be of some help.
I am sorry to hear that. What is making you feel sad?
What do you think you are doing wrong? Is there anything that can help you in the future?
How long has this been going on? Do you feel like you have a lot of unresolved feelings?
Do you feel that your mom is the reason you feel sad?
I am sure your mom will be happy with you.
It sounds like you have been in a very difficult time. What have you done to express yourself in a more positive way?
It can be hard to have a conversation with someone that has no idea what you are talking about.
Have you considered taking some deep breaths? It may help to calm your thoughts down a little.
Have you talked to her about her concerns? It sounds like she may have some good ideas about how to deal with them if she does not agree with you.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I think you should definitely give her a hug, maybe even a Happy Holidays!
Bye. Have a good day. I hope you feel a little better. Have you already started a new hobby?
Hi there, how can I help you today?
I'm sorry to hear that. What sort of job are you looking for?
Are there any other options you'd like to talk to?
I can understand that. I had a therapist before I had to start looking for new employment. It was a lot of work for so many reasons. I also had a counsellor before I started looking for a new job. I think it would be a great idea to get a look at the current situation.
I'm sure there are some jobs that you can try and find a new one.
I understand. I would definitely feel the same way!
I think that might be a good idea. Perhaps the therapist can be given to you in the form of a volunteer.
It may be worth a try. Perhaps you could look into volunteering?
Have you considered doing online therapy? Maybe you could meet someone to talk about your concerns?
I'm glad I could help. I hope you feel better soon!
That sounds like a great way to go. I think that would help a lot.
I think you should start looking for another job. If you are not able to find a job, you may not be able to afford it.
Well, I am sure it is not the first time you have been affected by this.
Of course! I'm glad I could help. Have a great day.
I'm sorry to hear that. What would you like to talk about?
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
I would suggest trying to keep your mind occupied and relaxed.
Have you considered speaking to a doctor about this? They can sometimes help with things like this.
I know it can be hard, but I know you can get through this. I think you can do it!
If you are feeling anxious, maybe take some time to clear your mind of any thoughts that may have come up.
That is a really good point. I think that you should try to talk with your doctor about this. I can understand that this is very difficult for many people.
Ok so it sounds like you have a good understanding of the issue. It sounds like they have a great understanding of what to do about it. I would suggest looking into the medication you are using and seeing if you could do that.
You're welcome! I hope you feel better.
How have you been feeling? I am sorry to hear that you are going through that.
What kind of things are you having going on?
Ok so you feel as though your parents are not doing their best and they are feeling underrepresented in the world
Yes they are both moms. I can tell by the picture that you are anxious to share your feelings with them.
Yeah that sounds like a really hard situation to be in. It's hard to see your kids being so emotionally overwhelmed.
That's great. I hope you feel better soon.
Well, your mom, I'm sure you are a wonderful person. I hope you have a great rest of your day!
I think you're going to be a great mom and I'm sure you'll do great!
I can understand how you feel. I know you will find a way.
What's going on? Is there anything particular that's bothering you at work?
Do you feel that you are losing your spirit?
Are you feeling any kind of loss in your job?
You should not let this become a habit. There are people out there who will understand and have a way out.
I have had similar experience in the past. I have found that speaking to my co-worker and having a conversation with them can really make things much better.
That is a good way to look at it. You are going to do great. You have a plan and you have the tools to succeed.
I can understand that, I have done the same thing with my co-workers. We had to stop communicating to each other because we had to talk about our issues.
It seems like you are in a very good place to be with your team. I think that you will be successful.
I think you are doing the right thing. You are not going to be successful and you should not feel bad at this.
That's great to hear. I think it's a great idea to start with a proactive approach.
You're most welcome! I hope I was able to be of some help!
What's going on? It sounds like you're having a hard time.
Do you have any friends or family that you could talk to about this?
What class are you in? I would love to know what classes you are in and what classes do you take?
Have you tried to talk to your professor about your concerns?
Have you tried talking to your professor about this?
Sounds like you have a lot of experience with online learning, especially as you are in college. Do you have any social media outlets like Amazon or YouTube that you could use to discuss your feelings with your professors?
You can always try and talk to your professor about this and see if he would be willing to help you through the day
It sounds like you are very anxious and can feel this way. It is important to let the stress out.
That is good that you are feeling that way! I know that you will overcome this and be much more than you think.
It was my pleasure. Have a good day!
That sounds like a great idea! Have you talked to your counselor about it?
It sounds like you are really trying hard to be a better person. I hope you can find the help you need and that you are not alone in this.
You are a strong person and I know you will find some help
You should do what you can to help and take care of yourself.
How long have you been following the church? Is this your first time hearing about it?
You are welcome! Goodnight! God bless you aswell
Thank you so much for sharing your feelings with me today. God bless you and please pray for me.
Hi there, how are you doing? Is there anything bothering you?
What's on your mind today? What is making you anxious?
Do you feel that you need to talk to her more often?
It sounds like you are having a difficult time expressing your feelings in a meaningful way. It sounds like she may be feeling the same way. Do you think it might be a good idea to talk to her to see if she's willing to express her feelings about it?
It sounds like you are saying that she may have some sort of mental issues or is just having a really hard time getting through this.
I'm sorry to hear that. I can understand how you feel.
I think that you should take that as a step in the right direction. Maybe even just a little more time with her, and perhaps even some counseling to try and see if she is having a serious problem with her family?
I can understand how that can be difficult, but maybe you can talk to her about it?
I am sure that she has a lot of support around her, and it would help to have someone in your life that can talk to her.
I'm sure that you can take that approach and be really supportive of yourself.
I have heard of this, it is a great way to get your mind off of it.
You're very welcome. I hope things go well for you!
You too! And I hope that you can connect with your cousin!
Bye! :) Have a good day! :)
Hi there! How are you doing today? I am doing well.
I understand how you are feeling. I understand how difficult it can be for a lot of people.
What do you think is causing your depression? Are you also depressed?
I am very sorry to hear that. I hope that you find peace and understanding in this time of year.
I can tell how concerned you are about this. I have been in a similar situation. I find that even though we are not being paid enough to be financially stable, I still feel like the government needs to provide for my needs.
That's great that you have a wife. That's the spirit!
I do that when I am stressed or stressed.
I think that is an excellent idea. I also like to drink more water when I am stressed or stressed.
I do that too. Sometimes when I'm stressed, I try and make a list of things I want to do in the next month.
I am glad that you are trying to do your best to stay safe!
I know right. I'm in Michigan and we have been getting very little snow this year. It was nice knowing that we were getting some fresh air!
You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon!
So you are having problems with your friends and relatives and family?
Can you tell me more about his condition? Have you tried talking to him about it?
Are you aware of any issues that he's facing that would cause him to feel this way?
Is it possible that your friend has a medical condition?
I have had the same experience, and have felt that this is what makes me feel better.
I've been in similar situations where my friend took medication for a long time after my dad gave it to me. I think that was the best advice I could give him.
I know it can be really hard to accept a message that has been sent in the past. I can tell from chatting with you that you have really struggled with this for a long time.
Well I would definitely agree with you that you're dealing with this through a mutual way. I have found that if you are patient and patient with your issues, you can do it.
have you tried talking to him about the things that he is having?
do you have any family or friends who could maybe help you?
how old are you? is that old enough?
You're welcome. I hope you feel better soon.
Yes of course. I hope that I've been able to be of some help to you.
honestly, I'm glad I was able to help. It was a pleasure speaking with you.
you're welcome. I hope you have a great holiday and stay safe.
you too! you too! enjoy the holidays!
Hi, how are you doing today? Can you tell me a little more about it?
Why do you feel this way? Do you feel that you are not being treated as well as you should be?
What do you mean? What do you feel like you are doing wrong?
Have you tried talking to your doctor? They might be able to help you if they can't.
I do not have a computer, so I am not sure what to do when my eyes are closed.
I have also found that when I get depressed I take a break from the daily routine and focus on the things that make me smile. I sometimes put on a watch to keep my mind off of things. I also try to take a few deep breaths and start breathing slowly.
It sounds like you have a lot of nerve going through this. Do you have any hobbies or interests?
I have to say that I really enjoy the sound of my own voice.
Have you tried any sports? There are some that you might enjoy.
I can relate to that. I also have a few weeks left to get my mind off of it and I still have a lot to do.
If you are not in a good place to start, I would suggest taking a walk every single day.
It's scary. I can't imagine how scary it is.
I usually just walk around in my backyard and listen to the news.
You're welcome! Have a great day! You too!
How are you today? Is there anything you would like to talk about?
I am doing well. How is your day?
Is there anything particular that has made you feel that way?
That's a tough situation. It can be hard to make sense of it all. I am sorry that you're having to deal with that. It's been a hard year for all of us. I can tell you're struggling.
Oh I understand. I've been in a similar situation. It's been so hard to get into so much of stuff lately.
It sounds like you're really working hard to stay positive and not let your emotions control you. I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific that you're trying to do to keep yourself occupied with?
Are there any other things you'd like to talk about?
That sounds like a great way to get out of a bad situation.
That's a great idea! It sounds like you're having a really positive attitude about things!
Hello, how are you? Is there anything on your mind?
why are you sad? is there anything you need to talk about?
did you miss him? i can understand why you would feel sad and sad
so you had a break up, did you miss it?
what is your problem? did he talk to you negatively?
do you have any friends that you can talk to?
try to live and go to school and try to make your mind clear
if you try to make yourself happy, that will make you happy.
yes i would recommend focusing on the past and try to make yourself happy
i think you should focus on the things that made you happy
she was depressed for 2 years after she left the world
He will come back eventually. Don't worry, just do what is right for you
try to focus on yourself and your future. do that.
i think that if you really try, you will get it
have you thought about going to a local meetup?
yes its a hard time for everyone but i think you can make it through this
yes, you will miss your husband and your friends
you should keep reaching out and talk to people who have gone through similar things
i like comedy movies too but you should try and find something that is not scary
you can try to find a comedy show online and watch it
thats good to hear, i know i am in the same boat
yes i hope that i was able to help you
You are welcome. I hope you get better soon
you are very welcome. I am glad you are feeling better
have a good day and good luck with your job
Thank you. i hope you have a great day
you too, bye! enjoy your day! you need to press quit and take the survey :)
you can come back anytime i can help you again
you are welcome. bye. you too! :)
How may i assist you in such a manner?
I am so sorry to hear that. How long have you been together?
I have had a similar situation and I am so sorry to hear that. I have a very similar situation. It is really tough but I believe you can make it through this.
I am so sorry to hear that. I know that you are feeling so alone and I know it is really hard.
I would definitely go for it. You sound like a very happy person.
I have a dog and a cat. They make me feel more connected to the world.
I see. So you think that you would be able to take care of yourself and your dog?
It's great that you are able to have him back. I am sure you can find someone that is willing to be around you.
I think it would be a good idea to have your dog with you for a while to get your energy back.
It sounds like he has a lot going on at the moment.
You're welcome! I hope that I've been able to be of some help to you.
Bye! Bye! Enjoy the rest of your day!
What is on your mind today? What are you doing to prepare for the next week?
Oh, I see. That is really hard.
Have you tried talking to her about it in a way that makes her feel better about it.
Are you talking about her being blind or was it an accident?
Have you spoken to her about this? Maybe you could reach out to her and tell her about how you feel.
How long have you two been together? Do you have a reason why she is not able to communicate with you?
I can understand how you feel. She has to learn from you, I can tell.
I can see why that would hurt your face.
I can understand that. I have been there, and it hurts to hear that you left her. I think you are doing a great job at keeping yourself occupied.
That's a great idea! That's so much easier than it sounds.
Is that something you'd be willing to do?
Do you have any friends and family to talk to?
That sounds horrible. How long have you been together?
Do you have any idea why they were cut off?
So you were a kid and never grew up?
Oh that's good! Have you tried looking for a new one?
You are very welcome. Bye! You need to end the conversation as soon as you have a chance to end it.
Good luck! I hope you have a wonderful day. You too!
Hi, how are you today? Can you tell me what happened?
what happened? did she break your heart? or was it just a break up and then it was over?
how long ago was this? I can understand how you feel.
how long have you been together? How did that affect your life?
do you think you are doing your best to make things right for you?
I suggest taking a few deep breaths. If you feel any pain, take a deep breath, and let yourself heal. If it hurts, take deep breaths, take some deep breaths and start over. If not, take another deep breath. If that does not help, take more deep breaths again.
I am glad you are feeling this way! You seem to be doing a great job at understanding how to make your life better.
I am really sorry to hear that. I can understand that.
Sure! I hope you can get back to feeling better and get back home soon.
Yes! I am sure you will. I think you will do great!
You're welcome. Enjoy the rest of your day!
I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?
I'm sorry to hear that. What sort of things have you been doing that made you anxious? Do you have a plan in place to get some sort of relief?
Is there anything specific you are worried about? Or is it just general anxiety?
Is there anyone you can talk to about your situation? I know a lot of people have been through similar situations.
How long were your family laid off? Do you have any specific reason?
I've also been trying to get a job. It's difficult. But I know you can make it.
That is a really difficult situation. I know it sounds like you are struggling but you have to make sacrifices. You have to do it.
Try breathing in and exhale a lot. You are already breathing.
Yeah! It's great! I use it to help me relax.
Yes! I hope it helps. It's my pleasure!
You as well! Stay safe! :D!
I hope I have been able to be of some help!
Hello! How are you doing? How may I help you today?
What do you mean by that? Have you tried asking them to leave?
What do you mean by that? Are you trying to keep it fresh?
It sounds like you have a lot of trust in your friends and that you don't need to be a party-champion
So if you have to choose between keeping your friends in touch with you and keeping in touch physically, you are not getting away from them because of COVID?
It sounds like you are trying to make it through this time with your friends. Do you think they would do anything else to help you out?
So you feel that they are trying to reach for help with things that might not be working out for you?
Have you tried talking to other people about this?
I can see that. I also have a lot of family that I can talk to about things that I would like to explore.
I think that would be great! It's not like there would be any other way you could play it. Do you have anyone you could connect with?
I'm glad to help! I hope things start looking up for you soon!
Of course! I wish you all the best!
Merry Christmas! :) You too! I hope you have a great day :)
Merry Christmas! I hope you have a great day as well!
How are you doing today? How can I help you today?
How are you? I am doing well. What is going on?
What has been going on? I am really sorry to hear that.
Have you been able to talk to someone about it?
I am so sorry to hear that. I know it can be hard to deal with the trauma of being a teenager. Is there any way you can talk to your ex about how you're feeling?
Have you tried reaching out to your doctor? I know some people do and they can help.
How long has this been going on? Is it a long time?
I understand. I've been in that position before. I think it might be a good strategy to move forward.
I understand how you feel. I know that I would not have the same feelings if I were you. But I think you are doing the right thing.
You are right that it would help if you share your feelings with your partner. But I think that you are not alone in feeling that way.
You're welcome. I wish you all the best with your new relationship.
I am doing well. How may I help you today?
What kind of stress are you having? I am a student and have had to deal daily with stress.
What do you mean by this? What is it that you are afraid of?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have any other hobbies?
And so many people are trying to do the same thing. You are a parent and you are capable of doing the same. This is good news.
I think it's time to move on from the stage of remission, as you say, and the mental aspect of it will come back to you soon.
You too. I hope that I was able to be of some help.
Bye, and good luck! And I wish you all the best!
Hi there, how are you? Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
What is making you feel this way? Is it the uncertainty of uncertainty?
How are you? Is there anything that you'd like to talk about?
Do you think that is the case? Do you think it is possible that you could apply to other jobs you have been looking for?
What do you think is causing you to feel that way?
Is it possible to work from home? Do you have a good computer?
Do you have any family or friends you could talk to?
I can understand how you feel. I also felt that people didn't want to leave home when I was applying for the job.
I believe that if you are good at something, you will find a better job.
I am so glad I could be of help!
So it sounds like you have a family that can support you?
I think it is important to let everyone know that this is not a permanent solution. If you have kids, it's not worth the risk of losing them.
You're welcome! I hope it goes well for you!
I am glad I could help! Have a great day!
You are welcome! I wish you the very best!
Hi, how are you? I'm doing well.
Have you tried talking to your doctor about this?
What do you think of the idea of having support from your friends?
Have you tried reaching out to your local counsellor?
What did you do to make you feel that way?
Are you able to communicate with him at night because he is blind or blind?
I am not sure how much I understand your feelings about cats or fish. I do not understand your concerns. Do you think it would be a good thing to give to a pet?
What is your pet's pet? Are you interested in pets?
I'm glad I could help! I wish you all the best!
It might be natural to feel that way. Are you able to talk to your doctor?
Do you feel that this would be a good way to start?
Maybe try setting your alarm so you can sleep more often.
I think that it might be a good thing to do, if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone.
It is really great that you are talking to someone that can help. I hope you feel better soon.
I am glad I could help. I hope that you are feeling better soon!
I'm sorry to hear that, is there something specific that has caused you to feel this way?
Are you having trouble getting by? Maybe you could talk to your doctor about this and see if there is anything you can do to help you?
Are you feeling any better now? Maybe you can try to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling?
Are you feeling any better? I'm sure you're doing great!
I can feel how anxious you are right now. I have been through this myself.
That's great! You can start by talking to your co-workers and seeing if there are any opportunities to make a difference in the situation.
I have, but I didn't do anything to help myself. I was in a very bad place for a while, but things really did get better.
There are a few online courses that can help you overcome this!
Yes, I adopted one myself. I think it's great that you have a dog!
That is great! You can always try and get a dog!
I hear you! I recently moved to a new place and my dog is my new companion. I also have a dog too. It is a great dog!
I have a dog and I always wanted a dog.
I hope that I have been able to be of some help!
I think that is a great start! You could even make a list of things you would like to do.
You're welcome! Good luck! And I'm glad you're feeling better!
can i ask why you are feeling this way?
how are you doing today? what's going on?
how long has this been going on? was it your husband's fault or your fault?
is there something specific that is causing you to lose your job?
ok i am glad that i can be of some help
what about his job that has been going on since the pandemic?
that is a great sign of maturity. you both have a great mind for each other.
have you had any talk about the problem with the other parent?
i would suggest having them play some video games to help you cope with the situation
I understand. I would not get too worked up over it. I think that you should focus on the other things that will help you.
I suggest doing that. You can try to get the job first.
yes, i agree. I think that is a great idea. You should talk to the best person in your situation.
I think it is a good idea to try and focus on yourself. It may not be the best idea, but try to do your best and stay focused.
I think it would be better to try to make a plan for the future, then.
I am happy to help. Is there anything else I can help you with?
You're very welcome. I hope things work out for you.
I'm sorry to hear that. What is making you feel this way?
What is bothering you? How can I help you?
What is making you feel down? What is making your depression so hard?
What do people do when they are feeling this way?
What do do you feel that you need to do to make you feel better?
Do you have a place to work? I have found that finding a new job can be very helpful.
Have you considered seeking out new work? I know it can get stressful but I am sure it will pass
I know that it's been tough for a while, but I know you can do it!
There are a lot of organisations that can help you find work that you like.
Yes, it is nice. If you have a few extra hours a week, you can do that and you will feel better.
It sounds like you have the skillset for the job. Are you worried about your future situation?
There are some online tutoring services that you can use
You are a strong person and you are not alone in feeling this way. It's been a very difficult time for all of us.
Have you considered looking into alternative career options? Maybe you could try something like an online school that you can look into?
There is no shame in being nervous. It is normal to feel nervous.
Try not to worry too much about anything. You are not going to get any worse.
You can do it. I think it will be a good learning experience.
you are welcome! And good luck with everything!
Youre welcome! Have a good day and stay safe!
you too! I hope you have a wonderful day!
You too and stay in touch! Take care!
Hi, how are you today? How are you?
What is going so bad about it? Do you have any other concerns?
Are you mad at him again? Why do you think that?
How long have you been together? Is that right?
Has he ever talked to you about that? You seem very understanding and honest.
Have you tried to talk to him about how you feel?
If you can't, I suggest you try to do some small thing like ask your friends for advice
Do you want me to suggest something that might help you?
Was he ever able to do that again? I am pretty sure he was never able to
When did this happen to you? It seems like you have a long way to go.
Maybe you should talk to a counsellor.
Maybe he will respond again. I can't imagine that would be a good thing to do.
Do you think you should go to therapy? Do you feel as though you have a solution?
I can understand that. You should take some time to relax and be more clear.
I know what you mean. It takes time to process the emotions and feelings.
Yes, sometimes things go by so slowly that if he is trying hard enough he will come back.
You should try and find someone to connect with in a more positive light.
I think that you should do what makes you happy.
You're welcome! I hope you feel better! Stay safe and have a great day!
Hello! How are you today? I am doing great.
What is causing you to feel stressed? I am in college right now and I know how difficult it is to be in college.
Is there anything specific you are worried about? I can relate to that.
If you feel comfortable with that, I would suggest you to look into some new hobbies that may be a great idea. I know some people are experiencing this as well.
I think that it might be helpful to be able to visually visualize the problem and perhaps outline the solutions that are working for you.
I can understand that. Sometimes it takes a while to process all of the complexities that are involved in life.
I'm glad that you have a list of things that you are happy with and that I could help you with some of those things. I know that there are many tools out there that you could use to feel better about your life.
I can understand how that can be hard. I sometimes get really frustrated with myself as well.
Your welcome. I am glad I could help.
You are welcome! Have a good day! Have you had a chance to try to talk to someone about the challenge?
I hope so! I'm glad I could be of some help.
I am doing well. How can I help you today?
I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are feeling a lot of pressure to be proactive and have a lot going on. Do you think that might be a contributing factor?
I'm sorry to hear that. I've been there too. Have you thought about trying to get away from COVID/19/19-19/20-19-20-20/19, then?
I am sorry to hear that. I do have a lot of friends in my home so I have to try to stay away from people who are close to me. It makes it very difficult to get to know people.
It's hard to see the positives in being so low on self-confidence. Have you tried exercising?
It's great that you are being mindful of it. I've found that exercise is a good way to get your mind off of things.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I can relate to that as well.
It sounds like you are not doing enough exercise. Do you have any other concerns?
I understand that, but it is worth a try.
Do you have friends you can talk to about this?
I think it might be helpful to talk to them on social media about how they are feeling.
That sounds like a great idea, that is a really good way to work out if you have the right tools to do it.
I understand, I have had a dog before and I have been stressed out about it as well. I was also stressed about it when I was younger.
It sounds like you are well connected with your dog and it sounds like your dog is doing great.
I am glad I could help. I hope that things work out for you.
no problem. I hope things go well for you.
Oh no! How can I help you? I am sorry to hear that.
What is your problem? I am sorry to hear that. What are some things you have been struggling with?
What is the goal of the project? I am interested in helping you make progress.
Have you ever considered reaching out to support groups or counsellors?
I am happy to help. Is there anything specific that you'd like to discuss?
I am so glad that you are able to express your concerns and concerns and are able at least to express how you are feeling.
I have a feeling that you will eventually get better. I have been there and done that.
Yes, I have a husband and daughter who look up and want to be there for them. They are very supportive.
You are welcome. It has been a pleasure talking to you. It will be okay.
You too! Have a good rest of day. Stay safe and stay safe.
I'm sorry to hear that. I know how hard it can be to keep up at work and I can understand how you are feeling. I also have been in the same situation myself. I can relate to you.
Do you feel that you are struggling with the work you do?
That is a great idea, especially for a company that has so many employees.
Perhaps the line manager could be there to help with that.
Have you talked to your manager about this? Maybe that could be a possibility. Maybe the line manager is a good fit for this.
Well I hear you on that. I think that most people are starting to feel the same way right now. Maybe you could try looking for new opportunities?
Yes, I do. I've also felt this way before. It's a hard situation to be in, but it's okay to have a conversation with your co‑workers.
Perhaps you could work from your home? That might be a good way to get to know them better.
It sounds like you have a lot to work on right now. Do you think you could offer some suggestions?
I think you're doing the right thing! You can't do the things you like without someone to listen.
That's really helpful! I have a lot of trouble staying positive when my boyfriend is telling me how to dress and how to act.
It might be prudent to spend time with them after work.
It sounds like you have a lot of patience with your work. Is that something that you can do?
I have had issues with the same thing, I have been in that position before and it was a struggle. I found that I was able to overcome it and move on.
Yes, you should take a hard look at that.
I'm good. Is there anything particular you'd be interested in doing today to help you today? I'm sure you can find some support in your situation.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific you are having problems?
How about getting a tattoo of your name on a piece of paper? I've found that that a lot people feel that way about tattoos. I think it's important to think about how to address the problem. Do you have any friends that would like to share your problems?
It sounds like you're feeling really insecure about your appearance. Is that correct?
Yes I have. I usually have found some nice things at Salvation Army.
That is a good point. It is good to have a second hand store to look at.
It sounds like you're having a hard time finding a second hand store. Are you able to access online retailers such as Ebay or Amazon?
I think that would be a great idea! You can do it!
It sounds like you are not being healthy and you should seek professional help for that.
I hope you have a great day too! I hope you can get through this!
You too! Have a good night! Bye!
Bye! I am going to try my best to help!
Oh no, that's really hard. I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling now?
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?
How did that work out for you? Did you see her in person?
I understand how that can be hard to do. I would suggest you talk to her and see if she can work through the feelings you had.
I think that's a great idea, and I think that you should tell her that you think you have a good relationship and she doesn't know your feelings.
I know it's a difficult time for everyone, but at the same time it is not a big deal to talk to your friends about it. They can take that time to process all of this information and help you.
I hope that I have been able to be of some help to you today. I wish you the very best.
I can understand how you feel. I had a friend like that and I went through a similar situation, but she never gave me any sort of notice. It was the worst, but it was still a very long time before I realized what was wrong.
It sounds like you are very soft on yourself and are not very smart.
You're very welcome. Have a great day!
I hope I have been able to be of some help to you today.
You too! Take care! Have a great day!
I understand. It's a tough time in this country.
Have you tried talking to them about it? Or do you think it is possible to talk to your friend about it for a while?
How do you feel about seeing another person that isn't drinking?
What are some of your favorite movies that you enjoy watching?
Do you have a counselor to talk to about this?
I think you should take some deep breaths and try to understand how he is feeling.
If you are not there, I can tell you have a serious lack of support and that you are being selfish and selfish.
You are right, but if you can do it, you can keep your friends and your family safe.
I am sorry to hear that. Do you think that you might be able to talk to him about this?
That's great. I think it would be a great idea to meet new people.
I am sure that you will find a way to make it through this!
Thank you for talking! I wish you all the best!
I can understand how stressful this would be. I can understand your fear.
That is totally understandable. I am so sorry you have to go through that. And I think you are doing all you can to help!
I am glad that I could help! You are welcome.
I hope that I was able to help. I hope you find something that works for you!
You are very welcome! Have a great day!
How are you doing today? Is there anything that is bothering you?
How are you feeling? Is there anything specific that has caused you to feel this way?
I understand how you feel. Is there anything specific that is making you feel that way?
I am so sorry to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with?
No problem, you seem to be a pretty selfless person.
When you are feeling unmotivation you can go to a gym or a book club and try to see what the motivation is behind your weight loss and what you do to maintain your weight.
Do you have a plan for the next few months?
I am not sure how long you have been following this advice.
I hope I have been able to be of some help. I hope you have a great day and I wish you the very best.
It sounds like you are working towards your goals and it is important that you can work toward your goals.
It's okay to be sad, but at the same time, try to take care of yourself and your loved ones.
I am glad I could help. I hope I have been able to be of some help to you. I am glad that you are feeling better.
I think that's a great idea! Maybe you could take a walk with your dog and take a nap or something to relax.
You too! Take care! It is important to remember that you have your best wishes.
Hi, how are you doing today? I am doing great.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried therapy?
So you are struggling with depression. How long have your depression been a problem?
What type of disorder do you have? Do you have a family member who is helping you? Maybe they can help you
It sounds like you're trying really hard to make sure you're not alone in this, and I think that you're doing your best.
You can do it! I know you can do this!
Are you sure they will be okay? I know that it's hard to tell them. I can imagine how you feel when they get old.
I think that would be a great idea. I hope you feel better and have a good rest of your day
I think that you can do it. It's been a really difficult time for everyone.
I would definitely recommend reaching out to your loved ones and asking if they have any concerns
I think that is a great idea, I'm glad I could be of some help.
Why are you frustrated? Is it your friend that you feel is taking your feelings out on her?
How long have you had this friend? Are you feeling this way? I know it's hard to get through this pandemic and you sound like you're trying really hard to make it through it.
How long have you been friends? I know that it's difficult to see how your friends can be so toxic and distancing themselves from you.
I would take it that he has some sort of misunderstanding or lack of understanding of the rules of the internet or that he is a little immature and doesn't want to be rude to you.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I can understand why you feel that way.
I think that would be a great idea! I would also suggest that you discuss the issues with your friend in person as well.
I have not, but it is possible to speak to someone who has a similar situation and make a suggestion that will help you learn more about this.
I would be concerned about the fact that he might feel like he has lost his trust in you and he is not going to feel the same way.
If you would like to talk more about the issue, you can! We are all working hard to help each other.
I know that it's hard to tell from this video alone, but from chatting with you I can tell how you feel about this.
You're welcome. Glad I could help! I hope that you find a solution for yourself!
You're welcome! Enjoy the rest of your day!
Hello, how are you today? How are you doing today?
Hi, how are you today? I am doing well, thanks for asking.
What happened? I am sorry to hear that.
Do you feel you have a lot of stress in your life?
Do you have a plan to find a job that will allow you to get the extra cash you need to get through this?
What kind of work do you do? Do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about how you are feeling?
It sounds like you have some experience working in a business, so it's possible that you could gain some experience there.
I understand. I had to do that myself when I was in college. It's not worth it if you can't find a job.
Try looking online and maybe finding some freelance work to help with your income. I know there are some great websites out there that could help you out. I believe you can find something there.
Yes, you can do it. You can also make a lot more money through Youtube videos and a subscription service
I hope so. I also hope you can find something to do while you are here
You will have the right tools to make the most of your time and effort. I am sure you will have a good job. Have a great time.
You could also get a job with some sort of insurance, even if it's not a full time gig.
I think it would be helpful to have a profile picture on your resume so you can identify yourself.
I would suggest looking for jobs that would pay well enough to live in Covid and have a home.
I know how difficult it can be to be an employee. But if you are motivated, you will get through this!
That's a great idea! Maybe you could go back and see if you could get your resume made with something like that?
It's great that you have the tools to do it. I'm sure it will be a great opportunity to get started.
bye! It was nice talking to you. I hope you feel better.
Hello, how are you today? Do you have any family members that might be able to help you?
So you feel like you're struggling to complete your assignments?
I can understand why you are feeling stressed about finishing your assignments.
I'm glad to hear that! I hope it helps.
I think it might be worth a try, I think you can make a great group of people.
I can understand that, I went through similar situations in my first year and it was absolutely terrible. It was a very stressful year, it's hard to not be proud of myself.
You could try and ask your friends and see if they can help you.
I think that is a great idea. I think you will do great!
You have a lot of confidence in yourself! You can do it!
I think that's a great idea! I'm sure you will do great!
It sounds like you're being prepared for the worst, and it sounds like it's affecting you as well.
You're welcome! We're all human, so it's important to make sure you have the most positive result.
I am sorry to hear that. Is he your husband?
Do you have any family members close by? If so, how old is your husband?
What would you say is causing you to feel that way?
What is her favorite thing to do? Tell her that you like her?
What is your concern about her behavior? Has she expressed this to her husband about the feelings you are expressing?
I think it would be a good idea to take care of your self esteem and keep your boundaries low.
I would encourage you to talk to your partner about how you value her. If she is stepping out of your life, that is a big deal.
That is a good idea. It is important that you talk to your friend first. It will make you feel better.
I hope that I have helped you a little.
That is a really great idea. I think it would be good to talk to your husband first, because if he is in your shoes, he is the one who needs to do the talking.
How are you? Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
Have you thought about working online to support your work?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered getting a job with a severance program?
You are very welcome! I'm glad I could help!
That's great that you are feeling this way and I know that it will all work out!
Thank you! It was nice talking to ya!
I'm so glad I could be of some assistance!
I think that would be a great idea! I think you can find some help from your friends and family as well. You seem like a good person!
I know that's tough, but I think you can make it this time. You seem like you are determined and ready. I believe in you!
I'm so glad I could be of some help. I wish you all the best!
You too! Take care! I hope you have a great rest of your day!
Hi there, how are you today? I'm doing okay, thanks for asking!
How are you feeling today? Is there anything specific you would like to discuss?
What do you mean? Is there something specific you'd like to talk about?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you spoken to her about it?
I see. I would be very upset if she left you with no closure.
you're welcome! I am glad that I could be of some help.
Well, it is important to take the time you need to do to feel better.
That is a really positive outlook. The only thing that I can see in your face is that you are a very loving person and you are doing what you can to make it through this!
You too! Take care! :) Take care of yourself!
how are you doing today? what's going on?
what’d you’ve been feeling that way?
how long were you together? i have a long relationship with my brother.
what happened? you said you're not comfortable with sharing your feelings?
maybe you should be more careful with your self esteem.
i'm sorry to hear that, what's going on?
i understand that you feel that way, but it sounds like you are trying to reconcile with your ex?
have you tried talking to your ex about the matter?
the people who do get hurt are the ones that are the victims.
i think the best thing to do is to think that he has learned from his mistakes and that he is trying to change things for you
yes, i think so, it is very natural.
you should try to see a therapist or talk to a therapist about the problem and try to focus on that as much as possible.
do you feel that you can get away with things if you talk to someone about it?
it sounds good to me. i think you should get some counseling
i see. that is a good start. it will take some time to get used to
i see you feel that you are doing everything you can to support yourself
it's always nice to talk to someone. you are welcome.
i can understand that. i am sure there are people out there who care for you.
can you tell me more about this meeting? what is your reason for letting this happen?
you should try to talk to your parents about it. it's important to take your time with your own problems
if you can't see it from your own perspective, then it's not your problem
your welcome, i am glad you are feeling better
and this will all work out in the end, right?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried looking for any job that might be able to get you through this?
I am so sorry to hear that. Are you in the same situation?
So your job is not as good as advertised?
What type of job are you looking for? I am applying for a job in my area.
What kind are you in? I am in a small company that is large and I know it's hard to keep up with the changes in the world. I am currently working from my home, so I have a lot of people struggling with the same issues.
I understand that. I was laid off because I was in a very bad position. I did not have the experience to be a supervisor at my company. I am also not sure if it is possible to find another job for you right now. Do your colleagues know that you are not going to get laid off due to the pandemic?
I can see how that is frustrating. Have the pandemic made you feel any better?
Ah, that's a good idea! I think that will help with your depression.
Have you tried to talk to your doctor about it?
I am very sorry for that! I know you are feeling very stressed but I know that there are some people out there who are able to help you with this.
Have you talked to your doctor about this? They may be able to help you with this problem.
Have you tried speaking to a therapist? That is a great idea and can be a great way to get your mind off of things.
Do you have any hobbies? That might be a good place to start.
Have you looked into counselling? That has helped me a lot
Thank you for talking! I hope you have a wonderful day!
Hello there, how are you? Is there anything specific that you are having difficulty with?
why do you think you could have been better?
What kind of job are you looking for? I know I had to change majors and I ended up getting a raise
How long have you been looking for a job?
It sounds like you're not having the right idea.
I'm glad I could help. I'm glad you were able to get through this.
I'm happy to help. I hope I was able to help a little.
Hello, how are you doing today? What are you feeling?
How may I assist you today? Is there anything that I can help you with today?
I am good, how are you feeling today?
Have you talked to anyone about the situation? I am very sorry to hear that.
Are you there? I am here to help.
Well, I hope that I've been able to be of some help.
I am glad you are feeling better. I hope I have been able to have a little more help with you today.
I think it would be better to learn from these past experiences to make yourself better in future. I believe that you can do it.
You as well! I wish you the best of luck in the coming years.
I am so sorry to hear that. Have you tried reaching out to any of your friends or family to see if they can help you?
Why do you feel this way? Is this a problem with your body or with your mind?
So you feel that you are not able to enjoy anything because of this?
That's great! I am happy to hear it. I know you can do it!
I think that would be a great idea! I'm sure that would make you feel a lot better.
Thank you for sharing with me and sharing with you. God bless you and stay strong. God loves you and you.
Yes, I am a counselor and I have a degree in counseling
I understand that you are feeling so sad and sad right now, I am so sorry to hear that.
You are very welcome! God bless you and God bless your soul.
It is important to remember that there are many different ways for our mental health.
I am sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific that you are having a hard time with?
I am very sorry to hear that. I have been in that situation myself, and I know how hard it is to move on from this situation.
Have you tried speaking to your family about the pandemic?
I have felt the same way for so long. I am not sure how to handle this time and the amount we have to do to cope.
I completely understand. I have had the same problem myself. I think you should use zoom. It can be used to identify the issues and work to solve them.
I know it is a very dark and dark time right now, but I know that it will pass eventually.
It sounds to me like you have a great plan for the holidays!
I understand that, but the only way to be free from depression is to have fun, which is a good way to get through it.
That is great! I hope you have a good day!
Yes, there is definitely a lot of outdoor activity out there. Maybe you could take some walks along the beach, or even drive around the city during the winter to pick fresh air.
It may be possible to just take a walk outside, if you have a nature park nearby.
I am sorry to hear that. What's going on?
I can understand that, I would too. I am in the same situation as you. What would you say is causing you to feel this way?
Are you a student or have you been exposed to a lot of people who are having similar problems?
Have you tried taking a break from your hobby? Maybe a new hobby?
That's good. I can understand how stressful that can be. Do you have any hobbies that you enjoy?
I think that might be a good idea, I'm sure it would be helpful for you to talk about that.
Well, at least you know that you are doing your best and that you have enough, so you are not going to get any worse. Do your best!
I think that is a fair assessment. Perhaps you should give yourself some credit for it.
Do you have any friends you could talk to about this?
I can see that you are feeling a little overwhelmed with your work. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Have you thought about getting some online counselling? I've found that there are many online support groups that can offer advice on how to make friends.
It sounds like you are feeling the same way.
You seem like you have a plan in place and you have faith in your abilities.
You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon.
Have a wonderful day! :) :) Have a good day.
Hi there. How are you feeling today? Would you like to talk about it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you feel like you're stressed out?
How long have you been feeling this way? I can understand how anxious you are about this.
You too! Keep yourself safe! You can do it!
I have to say that I have had a lot more anxiety about this pandemic than I thought I would.
I think that's understandable. I know the feeling. I remember feeling a little anxious and depressed before I knew anything else.
That's a good point! I think that would make things a lot easier. I'm glad that you have been able to keep your head up!
There's a difference between being ashamed of your lack of self worth and being ashamed that you've wasted your time and effort. I can understand how that feels.
I completely understand. I have noticed that sometimes we have to consciously change our ways of thinking. Sometimes we just need to forget that we are human and let ourselves change our behavior.
You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help!
That's a good point! I think that's a great way to look at it.
How long have you been going for? Did you meet any family members in the past that you thought would benefit from a walk?
It's not like you're going to be in a worse place anytime soon, are you?
I understand that. I understand how you feel. But it's okay to be selfish and not be willing to compromise your values.
You're very welcome. Have a good day.
I can relate to that, it is hard to get motivated when we are exhausted.
I have been in a similar situation myself, and I know it's hard but I know we can do it!
That's good! I hope you're feeling better now. I wish you all the very best!
Of course! Have a good night. :) Have a great night!
I'm glad I could be helpful. I hope you have a good day too!
You as well. Have a great day. I wish you the best and take care.
Thank you, you as well! I hope I was of some help to you today.
What are you worried about? Is there a lot of uncertainty or are there a few things that have happened that have made you feel uncertain?
What is making you feel that way? What do you think is making your anxiety right now?
Are there any concerns you have about the upcoming financial crisis?
What are some of the things that you have been worried about this year?
I can see how that could make things more difficult.
That's understandable. I understand how you feel. Sometimes it's the only way to be positive.
I think it's good that you're aware of the issues you're facing. I think you're more than welcome to be your own advocate.
You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help.
It sounds like you have a lot of issues that you are struggling with, but I think you have the right mindset to be able to overcome them.

I am sorry that you are feeling this way. I understand how you are. I am sorry you are going through this.
I know that feeling, but I think you will find it, and you will understand it.
Yes I totally understand. I also have to worry about things like that. It's hard to see things from the outside.
I have been in situations like this before and it's really hard to find a partner who knows where you are going.
I think the best thing to do is try hard to make sure that you have the confidence in them that you don't have to be aggressive or mean.
It sounds to me like you're feeling a little bit overwhelmed.
I'm glad to hear that! Take care!

Do you have any hobbies that you enjoy? There are a lot of online resources to help you get back on track.

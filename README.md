This is the PyTorch implementation of the paper: Applying-Emotion-Cause-Entailment-for-Help-seeker-Guidance-in-Emotional-Support-Conversations. The code is still in its early stages, and we will continue to refine it.

## Abstract
Developing a dialogue system for emotional support conversations (ESC) is challenging, as it requires addressing both general dialogue aspects and dynamic emotional interactions with help-seekers. Existing systems often fail to adapt to help-seekers' emotional changes, which are crucial for effective support. A supporter must understand when to initiate guidance; otherwise, help-seekers may reject support due to negative emotions. This study introduces the Dynamic Plug-and-Play Language Model (DPPLM), which integrates a transformer-based language model with two attribute models to generate strategic and empathetic responses. Unlike the original Plug-and-Play framework, DPPLM tracks help-seekers' emotional states using emotion-cause entailment, enabling better timing and balance between strategy and empathy. Evaluated on the Emotional Support Conversation (ESConv) dataset, DPPLM consistently delivered stage-appropriate responses, providing greater comfort and support. It achieved a BERTScore of 0.8531, Distinct-1/2 scores of 5.53/35.59, emotion accuracy of 45.25%, and strategy accuracy of 38.79%. In human evaluations, DPPLM outperformed baseline systems in overall performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in emotional support conversations.

Take it one step at a time and things will start to get and feel better for you.<|endoftext|>"

Information,You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It's easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help!<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome! Best of Luck!<|endoftext|>

Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It's really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own. You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it's a vocational program or temporary assistance.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,Those sound like positive ways of handling stress. It is natural of course to feel stressed out by the pandemic so it can be useful to think of ways to help manage that stress.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Have you tried meditation and/or deep breathing exercises? I know I find that helpful when I am worrying.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,One exercise I find helpful is lying on my back with a pillow under my head. I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support.

I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am sure that is frustrating! Does he drink at home as well or just when you go out?<|endoftext|>
Question,Would a date night at home with take-out and a movie just the two of you be an option?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Do you think you both might be open to talking to a marriage counselor?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","Well, what about you finding a counselor for yourself who could help you with your own self-care? Perhaps it could be a start and then he/she could help you end your marriage if you still want to. It took me awhile to learn my own value and how important self-care is.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know from experience that our self esteem suffers when we're in an unhappy marriage. It takes a lot of courage to seek help so I applaud you!<|endoftext|>
Others,I'm glad I could help and I wish you the best of luck!<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions,Providing Suggestions",it sounds like lack of employment has you down. Have you tried looking online or updating your resume. Indeed is a good place to start.<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,Ahh that is indeed frustrating. Do you have any friends or family that may serve as a reference for you?<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"So I would  suggest updating the resume, submitting at least 3 applications a day, finding some  references, performing volunteer work  to build your resume, lastly perhaps start up a new hobby or develop your skills in your free time.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Sounds like you have a plan, good work.<|endoftext|>"

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",that is a great idea and will get you off to a great start. I think that's about all I have to offer you unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,no problem you can do it!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello! How are you doing?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear that. What is the cause of your anxiety?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am sorry you are having to deal with this. Are you concerned about your own looks because you constantly hear this feedback from those close to you?<|endoftext|>
Question,I myself have gone through similar feelings when I was a teenager. I had body image issues for the longest time and my way of resolving it was through proper diet and exercise. Are you happy with how you look personally irrespective of what others opinions are?<|endoftext|>
Question,If you are comfortable with your weight then why are you so concerned with what everyone around you says or thinks?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you care more about what others think of you than how you feel about yourself.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you ever tried affirmations or heard of this before?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Affirmations are positive statements you think about yourself. What I like to do when I'm feeling really anxious is say three positive things/attributes I feel about myself over and over again until my anxiety dissipates. Do you think that could help you feel more positively about what those closest to you are saying so much with regards to looks?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Since you are stating that you are concerned about how you look, you should just find a few positive statements with regards to your looks you think about yourself and repeat them. So if you don't think you need to lose weight, you can say something like, ""I like my weight."" or ""I don't need to lose weight."" If you think you are beautiful or pretty, you can say ""I am beautiful."" My three affirmations I use for myself are: I am beautiful, smart, and funny. I say this over and over again until my anxiety has left me.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I highly recommend it! Is there anything else bothering you that I can help with?<|endoftext|>
Others,No problem! Glad I could help. I hope you have a wonderful day and take care!<|endoftext|>
Others,Bye!<|endoftext|>

Others,"You are welcome. Watch your thinking, when it goes off track, take charge, change your thinking, get up and move about and do something else because it's not healthy for you to worry. As you said, you freak out, and that is not good for you or your children.<|endoftext|>"

Others,Have you tried bringing up your feelings and frustrations to your boss or HR representative?<|endoftext|>
Others,That would certainly be frustrating. Have you tried speaking to the coworker directly and letting him know how his comments are making you feel?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I had a similar experience at work once. I decided to ask the coworker directly what I could do to improve. Sometimes if you ask them to provide the solution they can see you actively trying. If that doesn't work, maybe you could just ask your boss if there is a possibility of not working with him and instead another coworker?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Sounds like a great plan of attack. Just remember your own self worth along the way and try not to let him bring you down!<|endoftext|>

Others,Of course. Anytime.<|endoftext|>

Others,you are more than welcome. I hope your mom begins to feel better soon.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Your concern for your Mom is understandable. I can tell you are facing the fear just by thinking ahead as to how you can assist her.

Others,I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it :(.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,You have tried hard to help her and that is admirable. Don't beat yourself up and be proud of the things you have done for her.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"While I do not have kids, from what I have seen my friends and family do in this situation is try to find something that your daughter is interested in and attempt to build off of that. So instead of her learning to just learn, she is learning something that is relevant to her. Maybe that might spark something in her to come up with her way of learning since traditional methods aren't working.<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure",Having her go climbing more sounds like a good plan. Hopefully things are opening up around you now that the vaccine is becoming more common. Repetition is tough. I know I used a lot of flash cards as a way of learning through high-school and college. It's an old method but it can work.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did).<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Sorry for the delay. I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on. Gardening and Horticulture is a great hobby! That definitely could cross over into some of her science classes to make things more interesting and relevant to her.<|endoftext|>
Others,Glad I was able to help. Sometimes just having someone to bounce things off of makes a big difference. You have a good heart and good intentions. I wish you and your daughter the best.<|endoftext|>
Others,You're welcome. It was my pleasure. Please hit the quit button and take the survey. I can not end the chat from my side. Thank you!<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"My suggestion is to do all you want to do, really. Because I think you know yourself really well.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"For a social bees like yourself, staying home would be stressful. I would call all your friends and make some plans for the next year, plans for NYE 2022 etc.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am guessing sometime summer next year? We get all  shots and good to go.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,My friend suggested to get a party ticket for 1.5 year later. You're welome!<|endoftext|>
Information,"Anytime, by the way, I bought a year worth tissues, kitchen papers and toilet tissues. Hoarding is not recommended but it relived my stress.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,I do not know - there are a lot of nasty people out there. Have you tried confronting people who are bullying you and asking them why?<|endoftext|>

"Providing Suggestions,Others","Have you tried shopping in second hand stores? You can often get some nice stuff there for cheap. But really I think that the problem is your self esteem, not what you are wearing.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Right! To be honest I suspect that it's far more their problem than it is yours.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Yes I think that they were. I have had issues like this myself in the past and I know how much it hurts and how hard it is to overcome it.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",I went through a phase of wearing only baggy clothes because I thought i was overweight. Looking back I was not but I thought I was. Anyway I hope I have been able to make you feel a little better! All the best for the future.<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information","Maybe she did like the attention, but that is her own issue. It really doesn't have anything to do with you. Sometimes low self worth makes a person seek that kind of exterior validation from someone else.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"so, do you think that was the only way she could connect with you, through sex?<|endoftext|>"

"Reflection of feelings,Question","Sorry to hear that.  I absolutely understand, it's been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people. Do you think things will improve?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","I agree.  I lost a teacher some time ago and I've been thinking a lot about when things might improve.  A year seems plausible. Since it's so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up?<|endoftext|>"

We'll get through this, though, don't you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family.  We actually played games together recently.  Is that something you could do to reconnect?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is there any way you could talk to your supervisor about achieving a better work life balance?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","It sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you.  You just need a better work/life balance to straighten things out. I had a similar experience in the past, and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me.<|endoftext|>"

When I've gone through break-ups in the past, it's been useful to really take care of myself and give myself some pampering. Guilty pleasure TV and takeout Chinese food is always a good combination.  Tacos, too.  Maybe a bottle of wine, but not too much wine, just want to relax, not get sad.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","Oh dear, that's a long time alone with your thoughts. When I need to escape intrusive thoughts and rehashing things, I'll put on a podcast.  Or documentary, or something that's calm, straightforward and factual.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance",That's really good that you have that kind of relationship with your mom though!  Moms are awesome for that kind of stuff.  They can really make you feel protected and safe. The vulnerability after a break-up is unreal.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's awesome.  Family support is crucial.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Just be easy on yourself and know that in the future, you will find someone new, someone much more suited to you.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,Ah I am sorry to hear that. Please try not to worry too much as it's a common worry to have. Do you want to tell me the details?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,So you are feeling as though you are in the wrong place? Do you feel as though you might fail your class completely?<|endoftext|>
Others,But do you really think that you would have been admitted to the class if you were not up to the standard? Do you think that maybe most of your classmates are secretly feeling the same?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,This sounds like it might be a self esteem issue and not about your grades. I have felt this sort of thing myself and I do know how awful it is to be so hard on yourself.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you thought about seeing a therapist? Does your school have any free therapy programmes you could use?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Self-disclosure",A far as I am aware there are charitable organisations which can arrange a few free therapy session for you. Perhaps you could talk to your doctor about it? I have had free therapy sessions before and I found them very helpful.<|endoftext|>
Others,It would help you work on your self confidence and you might find that you are not doing as badly in school as you think you are.<|endoftext|>

Too often we are supposed to feel like we need to beg for a job, when in fact, you are interviewing them as well.<|endoftext|>"

"Providing Suggestions,Question",That could be a great distraction. You could start practicing soccer again. You definitely have more time for it now. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up? Sometimes talking with a close friend or family member can help a lot too.<|endoftext|>
Information,Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them?<|endoftext|>
Question,That is difficult. What caused the break up? Was it mutual? Or was it one sided?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Ok, so your ex broke up with you. Did they give you a reason why? Or did they just say it's over and that was it?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","Oh that is a hard one. I had a boyfriend and he cheated on me with another girl and he broke up with me because I would not do things with him that I was uncomfortable with. What do you think you could do to change your mindset? I know for me, writing helps a lot.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hi there - how can I help you this evening?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I can understand that, there are probably a ton of classes to select from.<|endoftext|>"

Self-disclosure,"Do you have anyone like a counselor you can consult with to help you make a decision? When I was in school, I developed a relationship with the counselor so I felt comfortable asking.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,No? That's too bad.  It helps to have like a mentor and maybe that professor would be a good source.  Sounds like a good plan.<|endoftext|>
Others,You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders and want to be able to get a good job when you graduate.  I think it is wise to seek advice now.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,I wish you all the best - I am confident you will do great!<|endoftext|>
Others,You are certainly welcome.  I'm glad I could help. Have a good rest of your evening.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am sorry to hear that. Tell me more about what is making you feel pressured.<|endoftext|>
Question,That sounds like a stressful situation so it is natural to feel anxious. Are there any coping mechanisms you have tried that have helped in the past?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I know when I am in a stressful it helps to take an occasional break to do some deep breathing exercises and meditation. Have you tried any of these techniques?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Yes, that sounds like a great idea. I think yoga can be very beneficial in managing stress.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I think it is important to remember to take care of yourself. That means eating right and exercising. I found from my own experience of going through a stressful situation that exercise was the best technique for managing stress.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I understand that there are days where it feels non stop and it can be hard to find the time. Excercising early in the morning is a great idea because it gets you off to a good start to the day. I like the idea of including friends too. That can be a great motivator.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Indeed it is hard to be perfect and no one is. It sounds as though you are very hard on yourself. From a practical standpoint, you could try talking about your grades with your professors and have a discussion about how to improve your grades.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,You're welcome. I know this is hard but you have got this.<|endoftext|>
Question,Thank you. That is kind of you to say. I hope my suggestions help. Is there anything else you want to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Others,I am so glad to hear that. I hope you have a great day.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"No, don't say that. There are people that are listening.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are there problems you would like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Why don't you feel like you belong? We're all human :). Have you been having these feelings for a long time?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's okay for you to have those feelings. The fact that you reached out shows you are getting somewhere.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It seems you would like to make progress with your problems. Would you like to discuss them more?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Sure, How can I help you?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question,Question",Working and going to school can be tough. It must be very stressful. Maybe you can take less classes or hours at work? Or what are some ways you can relax after a long day?<|endoftext|>
Others,I would ask for lesser hours if you can or study during your lunch breaks.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have not but I know people who are in your situation.<|endoftext|>
Information,I would look on sites like Skill share. You can learn a lot on there. There maybe some free courses to but I'm not sure.<|endoftext|>
Others,I think so. Doesn't hurt to check them out.<|endoftext|>
Question,Youre welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<|endoftext|>

Others,Youre welcome have a nice day/night!<|endoftext|>
Others,"Hello, how are you today?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I'm so sorry to hear that. I've had a close friend pass away years ago, and I understand it is a hard thing to deal with.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you have other friends there for you to help you through this tough time?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I doubt if they would see you as being soft. Maybe your mutual friends would like someone to talk to as well? You could perhaps share some stories about your friend and cheer each other up.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's a great idea. You could help each other and celebrate his life, keeping his memory alive.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That's a great idea. Maybe have a Memorial Service in his name at a place he frequented often, this way, no trolls and all the people who knew him could share their personal stories about him.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Let me reassure you that you would not appear weak. Death is something that everyone deals with in their own ways, and talking to someone about it could be the best way for you to deal with these emotions. Have you felt like giving up or extreme depression after his death?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance",It sounds like you're going through the normal grieving process and that time and talking about it can be of a huge help. You have taken the first step of healing by speaking with me about it. That is admirable!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm glad to hear that. I wish you the best and believe you will get through this!<|endoftext|>
Question,No problem. Is there anything else I can help you with?<|endoftext|>

Others,How has your day been?<|endoftext|>
Question,Has there been anything that has been bothering you?<|endoftext|>
Question,What do you think has been causing your depression?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That definitely is a very impactful event, but you've already been so strong for reaching out.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think it would be okay to allow yourself grieve because in a sense the person you were has now changed due to this event.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I understand, I had a similar event where I was taken advantage of with similar feelings.  I personally decided to share all my feelings with my new partner and we went very slow only doing things I was comfortable with. That may be a strategy you could use to help move back into having a sexual relationship with someone.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"In good relationships both partners have mutual respect for each which extends into their sexual relationship.  Remember you haven't lost your self worth, and you deserve someone who respects you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Your past is definitely not a burden, it's part of you, even if it's not a positive experience.  By sharing your past, it would bring you closer as a couple.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Another thing that could help you navigate new relationships is counseling.  I've had counseling sessions that have greatly helped me in the past.<|endoftext|>
Others,Of course!  I think we must support each other in our times of need.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello! How are you doing today??<|endoftext|>
Question,I understand that you are going through a stressful time with finishing up finals. Are you doing anything to destress.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is awesome! Sometimes it is really hard to take time for yourself.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"It is tough to take time, I am glad that you are making time for it. This time in quarantine has been helpful for everyone to slow down a little. Making it easier for us to give ourselves more self care.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I know, in the end we can only control what we do. It has been hard to be away from everyone. Have you been able to use any video chatting to help bridge the gap?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"At this point in the quarantine it has been hard to keep going with these strange practices. I have found some comfort in returning to the normalcy of a regular phone call. Are you self isolating alone, or are you fortunate to be with others.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I have heard that is the norm among colleges. That has to be really tough. So much of college is in the experience of being with other young people. You are fortunate because you are learning skills like how to be really flexible when it comes to tough times.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything else that is going on aside from the isolation that is stressing you out?<|endoftext|>
Question,I totally understand. It has been really tough. What are the things that you miss the most in this time?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am sorry to hear about your loss. How do you feel throughout the day?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It is sad indeed having a loved one past. Having time will help.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Some takes weeks. Others take month or years. It's different for everyone. I know where you are coming from. I lost my husband a couple years ago and it took me awhile to move on as well.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I think perhaps you could think of the wonderful times that you spent with your fiance, and cherish those feelings.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?<|endoftext|>
Question,That is so sweet. How are you feeling now with all these memories coming back to you?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Other ways to cope is perhaps taking a new hobby. Do you have any new interest that you would like to try? I took up a cooking class a few months after my husband past away, and I really enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think you will do fine in the kitchen once you get the hang of it. What are some of your favorite food?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Yes, I enjoy tacos and cheesecake as well, especially from the Cheesecake Factory.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Okay, I'm glad you are feeling better. Enjoy the rest of your day and stay safe.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I am sorry to hear that - how about reaching out to any family members?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I feel a lot of people are in your situation especially with Covid going on.  Do you connect with friends on social media at all (like facebook)?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can totally understand where you are coming from.  I think it is great that you are at least getting a little communication with facebook.  I am guessing you will be in line for a vaccination also in the up coming month which I think will help your mood as well.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others",I was able to get my first dose of this vaccine this past Sunday.  I was very surprised how good I felt this week like a weight being lifted off my shoulders.  I work with high school kids so it was nice not thinking about covid all the time.  I not it might not help for you today but I think it will give you something to look forward as you move forward in the upcoming weeks. *I know.<|endoftext|>
Question,Absolutely.  The weather seems to be getting nicer as well.  Do you like any outdoor activites (ex. walking outside)?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I think you got a lot of things to be excited about and look forward to - 1. warmer weather  2. longer-daylight hours  3. vaccine upcoming  - which then will open up the activities you enjoy like shopping and going out for coffee  4. Getting a puppy       In the mean time,  I think it helps to try to keep busy.   Is there goals you can set for yourself each day?  Like maybe working on a room for a puppy, to take a walk outside each day, an area of the house that should get cleaned, or start a new hobby (like finding a book you have been meaning to read).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe even with each day that you make a point to contact a friend each day either by phone call, email, or facebook?  Just say Hi - how are you doing? - look forward to meeting up at some point for coffee.   This might get an engaging conversation going with some of your friends.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yes that is good low-key way of connecting.  Rather than a call or text message.  I am guessing many of your friends are experiencing the same feelings that you (and many of us) are.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Yes it has been a long year in that regard.  I know being a teacher we finally start back with kids full-time April 5th so it basically has been a full year of distance learning and teaching through a computer.<|endoftext|>
Others,I am glad to help and hope you have a great rest of your week!!!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,No problem and great talking with you.<|endoftext|>

Question,Can you share the dilemma you are having?<|endoftext|>

"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",It sounds like this is really bothering you. It is good that you are talking about it though. Have you tried telling them how they make you feel?<|endoftext|>
Question,After you tell them how you feel do you still give them money or listen to what's going on and try to help them.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's good that you let them know how you feel. By doing that, you are taking the first step in now allowing them to take advantage of you.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",It's really hard to stand up for yourself but it sounds like you are off to a good start. Have you taken any steps in trying to form new more meaningful relationships.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So feel that this new couple might value the friendship with your husband more then you.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I used to have a hard time forming a meaningful relationship but then I realized it's because I had nothing in common with the people I was trying to form them with. Once I discovered something I was really drawn to I met people that way like volunteering in my community. Have you tried finding people you have more in common with.<|endoftext|>
Question,How is everything.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Ready for the holidays. So you tested positive, must be hard.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,That can be hard when you are working so hard to try to do your best.  Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?<|endoftext|>

Guys are a dime a dozen. I don't know what that really means but I think it has something to do with being able to get guys easily.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you'll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet. You don't want to be with a cheater. you should want to be with someone who respects you and treats you well.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance,Affirmation and Reassurance,Question,Others","I think if you make some time for yourself and talk to your friends you'll feel a bit better even though it sucks.

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","That helps me understand that this is quite a problem, however talking to you now I feel like you can trust yourself to eventually reach the best decision. Have you talked this out with your family and your partner together?<|endoftext|>"
Question,How did that go? Did everybody feel like they had their voice heard in a cooperative manner?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So you had a cooperative conversation, but not a very productive one, is that right?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I understand how those conversations go, believe me we all have them. They don't seem to solve much a first, but we better off doing it than not.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You're welcome, I hope you have a better understanding of the problem now.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That's good to hear, may I ask how the weather is today?<|endoftext|>"
Others,Hello.<|endoftext|>

Question,How can I help you?<|endoftext|>
Question,What is causing this fear?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Just from these few messages, I can tell you are very anxious about this situation.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you spoken with your supervisor about how you feel? Often times it helps to make sure your supervisor is aware of your concerns.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I can definitely understand this feeling, as I was also very worried at the beginning of the pandemic about my job security.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Another thing that really helped me was to take more time in the various hobbies I enjoy outside of work.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,You are growing apart from your best friend? Is this a good thing or not a good thing? Or you aren't sure?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Ouch! That is a sad thing. As I was sitting here thinking about friends I have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down.  Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues. Have you other friends?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Yes, and as you grow and mature, your life goals change, not everyone will travel with you. Right now you are starting out, I'm in the retired stage, lol Now I'm interested in helping younger people. It's amazing how our priorities change.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I've basically figured out life only makes sense with God, and I don't worry about a thing now, very little upsets or angers me, it truly isn't worth it.  A LOT of people have no goals. I think this is actually a good time to examine the year, what you did right, what you didn't do so right, and where you want to go next year.  I think self reflection is good for us.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions","A young neighbor just stopped by today, and he just moved out of his home, he is consumed with HOW do I pay the electric, HOW do I budget? How do I cook?  lol Like it is so interesting to see the journey in life. And my faith in Jesus Christ is really the most important thing. Do pray for your friend, and I will say a prayer too. Maybe he will come around some day?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I had two brothers die from alcohol and drugs. I had to learn not to enable them. Sadly, people choose their own life. There is opportunity to get sober, my husband is a recovered alcoholic.  When hanging with them and they do not want to change, sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away and let them hit bottom.  I have 2 brothers that DID find recover and a sister too. So my whole life was filled with people drinking and drugging. And I didn't want that life.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"there's a prayer called the serenity prayer, I don't know if you are familiar with it, but it is used in AA and NA a lot, learning to let go of what we cannot change, and that is people,.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Do you live in the US>?<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you placed your name on the lists?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Medication isn't always the best solution. I speak from personal experience. Also,  its better to be inching up a list than reluctant to be on it at all.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It absolutely can take that edge off, but often so can many other things, like painting, writing, talking to a friend or a stranger even. I don't mean to suggest you stop any medication without medical advising. I simply mean to say that there are advantageous methods of therapy that dont involve a pill.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You're absolutely right that sometimes there is a need for medication. My mother suffers from depression as do I. She has to take Effexor everyday for her condition. I,  however went through COUNTLESS combinations and never found a relief as helpful as when I write and talk to people.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you explored other theraputic avenues to synchronize with the medication?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You're doing VERY well talking to me! Had you not said anything, I would have assumed that to be the best  choice! But if you're an introvert, then my first suggestion is to journal.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","That way you can reflect on what you've written and possibly learn patterns, triggers, moodswings and other information that would help the problem. Journaling is for YOU. No one else has to ever see it if you don't want them too. Glad I can help.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you feel your friends are too busy for you.<|endoftext|>
Question,Why do you think you are having trouble finding a suitable romantic partner?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Sometimes meeting people through mutual friends is helpful. Have you asked any of your friends if they could introduce to you people they know?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","I can see how that would make it difficult. What about internet dating or going to a single's night? I am sure if you get yourself out there, you will definitely meet a great partner for you.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems Covid is making dating difficult for everyone.<|endoftext|>
Information,It is reasonable to use Covid as an excuse. I am sure there are plenty of women out there who are also confused about why they can't find someone.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am sure after Covid is over, there will be plenty of possible romantic partners coming your way. :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,You are welcome. Good Luck!<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am well, what's on your mind?<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I understand your concerns about being stressed, scared and depressed. The risk of family getting sick is certainly valid.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Its hard to stop those negative thoughts, but the first step is sharing your feelings with others and talking about it.  You are now on your way to healing.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I can see in your words how stressed you are and troubled.<|endoftext|>
Information,May I suggest that you seek some face to face support from a best friend or close family member.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Its still possible.  Social distancing, six feet away but in maybe your backyard or even a park away from others so you can talk with some degree of confidence that its private.  Just being around another person is so very supportive and positive. Please try.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"True. Remember, you are not the only one facing these troubles, others are tackling it too.  Try also to google online support groups on Reddit and blogs for additional assistance and suggestions from those who faced it and succeeded.  Doing what others did to overcome it means not having to reinvent the whole process on your own.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,I see - you find it hard to stay motivated when something pulls your attention to something you are more interested in doing . Does that sound right ?<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you thought about why doing your school work is important ?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,have you thought about scheduling free time for your self ? It can give you something to look forward to and help keep you motivated /Almost like a reward for finishing your school work.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,maybe if you only schedule free time and school work time - you can use it as a reward- plus it would help you stay on task.<|endoftext|>
Information,good question- changing any pattern takes practice . You could use the 3 r's  Reminder- Routine and Reward.<|endoftext|>
Others,great  so glad we came up with a plan.<|endoftext|>
Others,no problem  thanks for sharing your story.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Oh no, how long had you been together?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Wow, that's horrible. How do you feel about it?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Restatement or Paraphrasing","I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you have any family?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance",Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do?<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I'm sorry to hear that.  It must be hard. Can I ask what has happened?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.   That must be a hard situation, to not have your folks believe you.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you spoken with your sibling about why they lied?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sure it's frustrating when you know you're correct and no one believes you.<|endoftext|>

"Providing Suggestions,Question","So probably it's quiet.  this is a good time to take a breath and , literally try and sleep on it. What do you want to see happen?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","OK, I understand. So, then, it's how to figure out how to make that happen.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"OK, good for you.   It may not seem like it, but you can do anything for a year.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"So, the question is....how do you deal in the short term?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes.   I was going to suggest the ""grey rock"" technique. You would be only as polite as you need to be, and only engage others in a limited way.   You go about your business as you need to without the involvement of your other family members.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"you're welcome! I truly wish you the best.   Stay calm, you're a stone, and will get through this until you can leave.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Hey! How are you?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm good but why are you not good?<|endoftext|>
Question,Did they have a reason for giving you the pink slip?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You will find a job if you are determined enough :).<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you have enough money to keep going?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I think that selling your old possessions is a great idea. I can tell you are stressed just by speaking to you.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, pulling through this is the most important, because there may be a better future waiting ahead of you.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"It will work out somehow, I was made redundant a few months ago actually.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, I have stable work right now, but now I have learned to be prepared for the worst, but right now, you should do everything in your power to pull things together. Maybe do freelance in your free time? Special talents to showcase.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"Hello, how are you doing?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am sorry to hear you are near your breaking point, do you have any idea when the decline and stress began?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Work and personal life are very hard to juggle with each other, especially in the current life situations around the globe.  I am sure you will successfully handle both in the overall.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","For me, when I start getting overwhelmed and need to ""debrief"" my mind, and ""declutter"" the stresses, I use a notepad. I jot down every detail I can that pops into mind. Every upcoming task, everything that has caused anxiety or similar, and then I prioritize them in an agenda. It seems tedious, however once you get a handle on scheduling, in my personal ex.perience, it is easier to hold yourself accountable and slowly work your way through accomplishments, even small tasks, which is encouraging to continue. Sometimes, something as small as an.accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. Especially when listed and checked off to see the progress.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"When you visually see your success, I hope it will help like it does for myself. I personally believe that it is a useful tool, depression runs deep and anxiety pushes it over the edge with deadlines. Life and Personal are very complicated situations. As is living, in itself. Small accomplishments, maybe with minor rewards to.yourself as you go, boosts confidence and tends to fade out the overwhelming heavy feelings.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","A punch card. If you have one handy, a note card/index card. Draw maybe, 15 circles around the edge, and call it ""My rewards"" In the middle, choose one thing you enjoy, for instance, if you like an ice cream sundae, put that in the middle. For your first task, just jot all that is on your mind down, and also use that as the first task to yourself. Check off one circle, and once you hit 15 get that sundae! Awesome! I am happy to hear that it has already helped a little!<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I do sincerely hope you start feeling better, the current average life has altered greatly, and it has changed workloads and balances with great challenges.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Absolutely, I appreciate the chance to speak with you and give suggestions.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Perhaps, nature. A walk alone somewhere pretty tends to be a refreshing, zen-like activity. Or even, as a meditation type approach, rock stacking. It takes much focus, and tends to leave your mind clearer in the end. I also recommend reading, or listening to audio books of a theme you are interested in. It brings comfort in activities.<|endoftext|>"
Question,hello how are you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm doing well. Ok I can help. Whats going on?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you are unsure of how to deal with favoritism in the workplace. I have dealt with similar situations.<|endoftext|>
Question,When did this start?<|endoftext|>
Question,Can you tell me some examples about the injustice?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Is the logging out early a reward for their work? I had a job that offered similar rewards based on performance.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is very inappropriate. This must be very hard for you.<|endoftext|>
Information,"If your manager has a supervisor that you feel would not approve of this behavior, I would speak to them. If you don't feel that would be beneficial to you, you could reach out to your company HR department.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I would not be able to let this go either. I'm so sorry you're in such an unfair and unethical work environment. Do you know the supervisor well or interact with them? It could backfire if they both interact with this behavior. I believe you will make the right decision. If it does backfire, this is a toxic work environment and not a good fit for you.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You are very welcome. It does feel good to communicate with people who can understand how you feel. I wish you the very best of luck.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You're welcome. You be safe as well.<|endoftext|>
Question,What do you think is the cause of that?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh, so it's the public speaking that has you rattled?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds like it'd be enough to upset anybody.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think most people aren't big fans of public speaking.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Well she sounds like kind of a pain in the ass honestly, I had a teacher like that one time myself.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe you could try and just put things in perspective.  I mean this will all be behind you soon enough, and no matter how it goes it's not like you're going to wind up on skid row over it, I wouldn't think.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"So in the short term I'd just try to get a good night's sleep, give it your best shot, and keep in mind that it's not really all that significant in the grand scheme of things.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Well my pleasure, I hope that was of some help!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Well good!  So now what do we do?  Does this count as finishing the hit?<|endoftext|>
Information,"Hang on, let me look and see.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I'm sorry to hear that, what is the issue that you're having?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Is it crucial that you be in the South versus Northwestern region? Are you willing to lose her in order to move South?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"A compromise would definitely be the best and most fair for both of you. You may just need to sit down and ask some tough questions to determine where she sees things. She may be thinking the same thing you are. Without knowing where you stand on things or where your relationship is going, she may not know how to completely plan the future for herself much less the two of you.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Somewhat but not identical. My now husband and I attended different colleges and we both agreed on a fairly selfish approach of finding our careers while dating and not letting our relationship dictate what either one of us did. No one wants to be the reason someone holds back or gives up on something they've always wanted.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"You don't want her to resent you for telling her you want her to move South, but that goes both ways. She needs to be willing to see your side too and you'll need to make those decisions together.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Great, the sooner the better. I have a feeling you'll both be relieved when you do.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sure she's considered it, expressing interest in both of those areas could just be that you're sending mixed messages too. So really, just talking it out is your best bet. Good luck!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I can understand how you might feel anxious. There are lots of uncertainties right now. I am sorry you are going through this. Are you able to find work or help from the government?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Living with uncertainties can make anyone feel anxious. Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am happy to hear you have support during this time.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Luckily, there are many platforms online that allow you to work from home. I know of several that allow you to do side ""gigs"". Perhaps you can search and find a few of these.  I, myself have had success doing these.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Many have found meditation helps relieve anxiety. Most importantly, if you find yourself feeling depressed or worsening symptoms, please contact your medical professional.<|endoftext|>"
Others,It was nice speaking with you today.<|endoftext|>
Others,Happy Holidays to you as well!<|endoftext|>
Question,how are you doing. What is troubling you dear.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"if i get you right, you are fired because of your health condition.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","that's really hard, i can feel your fear. i lost my job also because of covid economy inpact.<|endoftext|>"
Information,have you try looking another job from nearby.<|endoftext|>
Others,that's a good news.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,you can also go online.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,you are welcome. you have to keep it together for a while before you get one. But i believe it will be soon.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"i have found a pert-time job also, it doesn't pay much but its better than nothing.<|endoftext|>"
Others,exactly.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello , how is it going ?<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,"Thank you ! I don’t believe it is necessary. There are materials out there and you can for sure learn on your own . For me, I like having someone to ask questions .

Affirmation and Reassurance,You can actually use this as a motivation to show your ex how much he missed.<|endoftext|>

Others,"Use the time you have now to invest in yourself. When you're the best version of yourself, the right person will come to you natually.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","No, there is no reason trying to win that guy back, Even if he comes back after you get successful, he's after your status, not you yourself. Of course, however, the best person will come in your life when you're not looking.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"As I said, good things will eventually come to you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"If you feel lonely, talk to your friends and share your feelings with them.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm glad I could be a bit help for you.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question","Very well, thank you. What's on your mind?<|endoftext|>"
Question,That's tough. How long have you been together?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Five years is a long time, and to make a relationship work in the long term, you used the magic word...""effort."". Do you live together?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Information","It sounds like you are basically living in a long distance relationship, given the circumstances. It's very hard to make a relationship work when you can't see each other in person. It takes a lot of effort.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Do you think she shares your frustration and concern, and if so, have you talked about it with her?<|endoftext|>"
Question,How much of this distance between you do you think is related to COVID measures?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question","Video chatting definitely isn't the same, or natural. It does take more effort, certainly. How much did you see each other before COVID?<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions,Information","A lot of relationships right now are in ""survival mode"" due to the pandemic. The only way to make it through is with a lot of effort. This lockdown isn't going to last forever. You just have to make it through. I would definitely suggest you talk to her and make sure you're on the same page, even if that's scary. If she knows you want to find a way to make things work, then she'll work harder, too.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I know you can just about anything delivered out there. I think a gesture of something tangible would be a good idea, whatever it might be. Maybe delivery of flowers and a pizza?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Just look for ways to stay connected and you'll make it through!<|endoftext|>
Others,You too!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is good to hear.<|endoftext|>
Question,oh no i am so sorry to hear that! What seems to be stressing you out the most about it?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,i am sorry to hear that i know that must be really stressful this time of the year.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I feel you on that, we are a one income family and trying to find the extra cash to provide for our kids Christmas is always a big factor for us. Do you have any family or friends that you could talk to that may could help you out until the first of the year?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I am sorry to hear that. Have you spoke to your husband about the stress you feel from his hours being cut? Maybe you both could come up with a plan to move some bills around to make it work.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,"I understand that, my youngest has autism so my schedule is very limited.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I wish i could have helped you better. Try not to stress it to much as hard as it is not to be able to give them what they want the bright side is they are so small that they will appreciate anything you can get them.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I see. You feel unlucky and disappointed that the teachers cause your courses to be challenging?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Course work is already stressful enough but to be challenging in addition only adds to the pressure.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I remember an English teacher of mine, always calling me out in class, saying that she expects better of me when my papers weren't the best. Her class was hard and I worked hard to complete my assignments as instructed. Instead of her speaking with me personally, she'd embarrass me. I did not like her class at all.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Is there enough time to maybe select more compatible teachers or speak with the school counselor about classes that work best for you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That is a great idea. I'd encourage you to speak with your school counselor to share your needs and maybe the 2 of you can come up with a plan to create a schedule with teachers that can help you be successful.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I believe you are correct! Less stress certainly creates a better learning environment. School counselors are your ally. Remember, you can go to them anytime you need them. Are you stopping by this week?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I am so excited for you! This is a big step! Looking out for yourself, to assure you are happy, less stressed and learning the important things to be able to graduate.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"For your next year, asking upperclassmen about their teachers can give you insight on who you may have next year. The more you know in advance, the better you can plan for what to discuss with your counselor. So proud of you! I know you 2 will come up with an awesome schedule!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Good Luck!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Okay, I know the feeling! Can you at least make a start tonight? That will make you feel better.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Naughty! Though I must admit I understand that feeling too ;) Could you not at least rattle out a few paragraphs before you go?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Question",And try not to overdo it or you won't be able to work tomorrow either and then you'll really be in trouble. Have you at least done some groundwork for the paper even if you've not started writing it yet?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",Well at least you can continue mentally preparing for it when you are out tonight. Nobody ever INTENDS to get blackout drunk :D.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"And you never know, you might get a creative burst when you get back and rattle it off in one.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Oh yeah. Follow it up with a smoke and you'll be a regular Shakespeare. He was probably half cut all the time too.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,i live in a rural area with lots of forests :P.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Hmph I am not a very good counsellor am I? I should be telling you to stay in and work. But hey, life is short and beer is good.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Of course :). Hmm it's been many years since I was in Uni. Too many.<|endoftext|>
Question,Ah it's a good field to be in. Do you suffer from anxiety generally or is it just over this paper?<|endoftext|>
Question,and exams too I will bet. Does your school offer any free counselling?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I wish you all the best with it and thanks for talking! Do enjoy your night out and don't overdo it ;).<|endoftext|>

Information,"I see, have you just started them?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"With medicine like that, it can take months to take its full effect. Stopping can reverse and even make the depression come back worse. Have you told your Doctor your concerns?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Hmm, well yes this can be helpful but that is strange he did not run any tests to see how the medication is reacting with you. On that note though what is going on with you now?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I would look to talk to a therapist about these matters. Platforms like this can help with some issues but if you are not reacting to the medication and these thoughts are still occurring then that is the path i would take.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Im not telling you to quit on your therapist but if their techniques are not working for you, or you do not think they are a good fit. You should not feel guilty looking for one that is better suited to your needs. Self harm is a very serious issue that strangers really cannot help you with.<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,"It's such a hard time right now, knowing what is the right thing to do. Does your district offer any virtual options?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"That's frustrating, obviously you want what's best for your kid and it's going to take time.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think the important thing to remember is that we're all going through similar things. Which probably increases our anxiety because we don't have any good way to express our frustrations since everyone else is in the same or worse position.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"While we're busy worrying about things like education and jobs, I like to look for the little messages of hope and empathy that we'[re seeing through all of this as well. It's a good teaching moment for our kids and showing how to collectively work to take care of one another.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Just think of all of the ways our kids are learning to adapt to different life situations as well. That's worth just as much as their formal education. Your concerns are valid, and hopefully finding another safer school works out and this whole thing is over soon.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That's a great idea, helping fill time with things to distract is a good way to relieve stress as well.<|endoftext|>"

"Others,Reflection of feelings",You are most welcome. We have five minutes left if there's anything you'd like to talk about in addition to what you have already told me. Perhaps you could tell me if you feel a little more positive now? You do sound it.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions","I am glad to have been able to help. We all need someone to talk to during a time like this. Perhaps you should make a plan for some sort of treat a month from now, when things will hopefully be better? Perhaps go out for a pizza night with friends or something?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others",I do enjoy promising myself treats if I fulfil certain goals. It can be anything at all! Anyway it has been lovely to talk to you and I wish you all the best in the future.<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",This has been a pretty hard year for everyone. however you ultimately gotta do whats best for you. Have you considered searching for a new job?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I'm in the same boat. I would say, the things that work best for me, are to take breaks during my work day and go for walks or as soon as I'm done with work I force myself to go for a walk. I find moving helps me feel better. I also use that time to think about how I can look for a new job or rethink the things that are bothering me. maybe you can try something similar?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Change the scenery, it'll help! plus movement releases endorphins which make you feel better.<|endoftext|>"
Others,no problem!<|endoftext|>

Others,Hello there.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,I have also felt that COVID has added additional pressure in my life. You are not alone in thinking this. It must be tough.<|endoftext|>

"Others,Providing Suggestions","I heard about Biden's plans as well! Luckily, I paid all of my debts already but I think it will be great for other people. Perhaps if you are unable to find another job to reduce the principal, you could try setting aside a certain amount of money each month to put towards the amount owed?<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sure it is hard to express how you feel with it being a short relationship, people may not understand. But sometimes we can feel such a strong connection and have faith in people very fast.<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,That sounds really stressful.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you in a program that lets you choose your own classes?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","Oh, that's rough. I've had classes before where I had to take them but had a lot of trouble. Do you know anyone in the class? Maybe you could try studying with them and see if they can help.<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Information","It sounds like you're overwhelmed by all of the things expected of you. Sometimes schools have programs that can help with this sort of thing, like student support services, that might be able to get you extensions on assignments, or move tests around if they fall on a similar date.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You might be right, it depends on the school honestly. It might not hurt to try though if you're really overwhelmed. Another thought is to try talking to your professors or TAs? They might be more sympathetic than you think.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","I've been a TA for classes before, and even though I sometimes can't do too much to change assignment deadlines, I've always been open to talking to students about their struggles. It helps me to know who to keep an eye on and give extra attention to. Are you feeling any external pressure from your family or advisor to do really well?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That sounds so hard, I think it's awesome that you're trying so hard on your own. Just the fact that you're in a program in the first place is really impressive.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"That makes sense, but it might be helpful to think about the other person's situation. Perhaps he/she hasn't had the same amount of training? Perhaps, they just need a little more guidance than other people who are more able to complete the tasks.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What aspects do you especially have a hard time relating with?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That does sound exhausting, though some people might be reluctant to share their personal experiences, and it might be helpful to start smaller when getting to know someone and working up to more serious conversations.<|endoftext|>"

Self-disclosure,I often feel the same way when I'm not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"You sounds pretty stressed about it, make sure you're getting enough sleep so you don't get run down.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is there someone you could study with to help break up how you're studying?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Try not to think of yourself that way. I'm sure you both provide a benefit to each other while studying.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I also felt that way around finals and with friends, I think it's important to recognize this is one semester and that it's equally as important to take care of yourself as it is to pass those finals.

Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sorry, I've been in that position before. Do you feel it's for the best?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"That's really hard, especially when there's chance it could have worked out if it wasn't for the distance. Do you regret choosing to go to the school near where she lives?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Definitely feeling like you're living for someone else and having them not do the same is hurtful. Although it seems like you're the one in the relationship who is willing to make more sacrifices.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Oh ok then it's not the first time this has happened. I think you might be right, if you notice a pattern then it might continue to happen.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions,Question","Most likely, she seems to need space to live for herself and is less willing to make sacrifices for you like you do for her. But even it won't happen again, you shouldn't have to live worrying that it will. Have you spoken to her about how you feel?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Wow I can only imagine. But I think it wasn't a waste if there were good times and you had room to grow. In relationships you have to prioritize your own happiness and I'm sure if you mentioned that you're frustrated and hurt maybe you can understand how she feels and why she made the decisions she made.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Absolutely not! Individual frustrations are the best things to focus on before everything that happens in the world.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","I think it's important that you talk to her and get the answers you need. She might not even have been aware you feel this way and assumed you were happy to move for her. Although again, I'm really sorry you have to go through this during the holidays, definitely sucks but doesn't mean you can't at least get some answers and move on with your life.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you for talking to me! I hope it all works out.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Hey, how are you today?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes I understand, I'm from the east coast and I'm deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can't change the situation because it human nature.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"However, we shouldn't let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"I completely understand, the pandemic and having added responsibility definitely has been very isolating and can feel like you're losing your sense of self.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It's completely normal to have that sense of guilt for feeling that way as well. This whole situation is not ideal for anyone, which somehow makes it worse. It's hard to talk to someone about these feelings when you know everyone else is in the same or worse situation.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It's taken a while to figure it out and get on the same page with my husband, but I try and practice self-care when possible. It can be something as simple as going for a walk alone or sitting and reading alone. There's no shame in needing some time alone to reset.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I'm glad to hear it, good luck to you as well. I hope you're able to practice self care and reset. Stay safe!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Too kind, thank you.<|endoftext|>"

Self-disclosure,I thought about the good times and bad.  I went over why it didn't work.  I realized that it never would have.  Then I carried that new knowledge to my next relationship.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",It was time and meeting new people/partners.  I knew after the breakup more about myself and what I needed in a long term/life long partner. Have you been dating other people?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"They have been great people?  You need to learn/remember what you liked most about the partner that you are talking about, what you didn't like most, and find both a new partner.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know you will find the rigt person.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,It took my 2 years after my last breakup to find my now wife!  Just be patient and keep looking.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Well, you could read a few books about relationships?  Do some research.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Not really, I would just look online, and type in relationship books and look at reviews.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"Do you live alone? Did you work at home before COVID? I worked at home before COVID but with COVID I became very isolated. I don't have any neighbors within sight of my house. This my sound weird but I make up  fantasies in my head like I am an alien's pet and my home is my habitat or I pretend I am hiding out  keeping something safe, or a pioneer woman waiting for her family to get back from the store which is a six  month trip.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am glad you are able to work, financial stress really sucks. I think Covid has us all down at least at some point.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Yes, and it doesn't seem to have an end in sight. But at some point it will be over. If you don't feel more like yourself say a month from now I have to seeing a doctor because some depression requires it but that said some depression is normal and usually precedes change. I was told that it sort of erases our expectations and allows us to accept the new thing in a better way.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You sound  stressed over things that you have little to no control over. Take a deep breath. Tickle each other. Pretend you are the adam and eve couple traveling to populate a new world and the house is your spaceship run with it and have some adult play time lose yourselves and destress. It is good that you can enjoy the sunshine and the park. You can only control and influence what happens around you. Concentrate on making that a good place to be and that will change the world a little at a time.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Just hoping to make you feel better and help with some of your worries that don't need to add to your stress. So you don't seem to be depressed as much as stressed and worried which is interfering with things, would that be accurate or could you explain more?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Positive attitudes are never bad, slightly annoying to some first thing in the morning but in a good way. lol.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Coffee sounds good. You are welcome and thank you for sharing!<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So just to make sure I understand, you are having issues with your amount of drinking and are struggling to stop?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anything specific that is causing the drinking?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure",Just from chatting with you I can tell you are very disappointed.and upset about this. I also used to struggle with the amount of drinking that I used to do.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,One thing I did was talked to my family about it and also spent a lot more time on my hobbies that didn't include any drinking at all.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"That was when I would focus on another hobby of mine, in my case I would either pick up a book and read or work on model cars.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes, I definitely think that will help!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know it is not an easy thing to do, but you are gonna do great!<|endoftext|>"
Others,You as well!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello there. How are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am really sorry to hear that. Is it something specific that you'd like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Others,I am really sorry to hear that! Is it related to the pandemic or have you doing badly in your exams?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Please try not to worry. Do you have someone to advocate for you in the appeals process?<|endoftext|>
Information,I think you should look into getting an advocate. You have a legal entitlement to have representation.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Ah I do understand. I have been frustrated when things grind to a halt at this time of year too. Can you ask for an extension on your appeal time?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That sounds very harsh, especially given the current situation. I suggest that you find out where you stand legally because I am sure that this can't be right.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I can tell you are feeling really hopeless and anxious right now. Do you have any fun plans for the season?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I think it would be a good idea to try to coax yourself into going. You will probably enjoy it when you get there :).<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you considered speaking to your doctor? You might benefit from some medication or counselling.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I am sorry. I suffer from depression also and am on medication so I can understand your pain.<|endoftext|>
Others,Unfortunately the current global situation is not helping any of us. It is terrible to feel scared all the  time.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you could make a list of things that you mean to do in the New Year to give you something to focus on?<|endoftext|>
Others,Make sure to only choose realistic goals so's not to make yourself feel despondent and do not be too hard on yourself if something does not work out! A journal is a fantastic idea. You can track your personal progress over a period of time.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Unfortunately, depression does mean that we can judge ourselves far too harshly. I have been guilty of that myself in the past.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I hope I have been able to be of some comfort to you and given you something to think about. Have a lovely Christmas!<|endoftext|>
Others,Take care!<|endoftext|>
Information,(You need to finish from your end .. I can't :)).<|endoftext|>
Question,Happy to be here. Is there anything on your mind?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,This is a hard time of year for many people. It sounds like you are thinking about a specific person a lot of the time.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything you can think of that would help you to feel better?<|endoftext|>
Information,It sounds like things ended in an unresolved way. That can make it feel like there is no real conclusion.<|endoftext|>
Information,"yes, there is a lag in the system. it takes a while for the response to upload.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, I agree. Sometimes it just takes time to process all the emotions.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, that's a good point. It sounds like you are thinking this through in a good way, but the emotions are hard to process. Letting yourself feel the emotions is an important part of getting through a difficult situation.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"It is understandable to want to keep photos. Distracting yourself might not be the solution; that could stop you from processing the emotions. There is a stage of grieving for a lost relationship that happens when a relationship ends. There will be grieving for the person, and for the relationship with that person. That is what has to be processed in order to move on.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That makes sense; you care about him so you miss him. This is one of those things that will take time. Accepting and acknowledging the emotions, even when they are painful, will let the emotions evolve and over time they will become less painful.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, it must be a painful experience. The end of a relationship is a loss, and there is a grieving process to go through. That is a painful experience. I am sorry you have to go through this. I believe that you can manage this experience and end up a stronger person.<|endoftext|>"
Question,How are things going?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything in particular that has been bothering you recently?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm really sorry to hear that, but I'm sure your love for your kids can still shine through.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Would it be possible to look at some more home made stuff for this year that will still be fun and meaningful?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know it can be really hard to feel like you can't make anything worthwhile, but I'm sure theres something you could come up with that could still put a smile on your kids faces.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Maybe you could look at involving your kids in the process. The feeling of doing something together as a family can make it way more fun. It could be a shared experience your family can look back on fondly later on.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","I have seen some people make small ornaments filled with candies and treats and other small goodies. So even if all of the gifts feel small, they can feel like they are getting a lot of them. And you could even get them to have fun decorating and painting the ornaments! Yeah, a box fort is really fun!<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"When I was a kid, I loved making box forts, and its a great way to reuse stuff you might already have around the house. The fun pretend games you can play were a blast. I'm sure your kids might love it too!<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","It can feel tough when it feels like you can't provide all the big gifts that you feel your kids deserve. But you clearly care and love your kids, and want to do something for them.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Last Christmas when I gave gifts to my family, one of them later told me that the gift they loved the most was the box of Christmas cookies that they were able to enjoy over the course of the week afterwards, and not the keyboard I had gotten them.

Question,Have you tried picking up a new hobby? Something you have always thought might be fun but haven't ever tried because of lack of time or energy?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I do like reading now. I took some time after school to take care of my mental health by going on walks and being in nature. Overtime, I started to pick up books again. I've found I really like true crime and autobiographies the best.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Rock climbing is so fun! Have you tried taking a beginners course? I started there. I was very nervous I would be made fun of, but found that it was a really supportive community.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You might find it's just the community of people that you need right now. From my experience, they were all super friendly and open to helping me along the way.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Just from chatting with you, you seem like such a nice person. I don't think anyone would have mean things to say about you.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"First of all, I have a fre questions to ask. Does the idea of him being sex addict change how you feel about him?<|endoftext|>"
Others,I would say you should cut tie with him. Being  into porn is a serious issue but what's more important is he lied to you about that.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think you can also feel it yourself that there's something not right between you and him.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","This is a wake up call for you I must say, to get away from him. I think you should sit down and tell him to take a break, this doesn't mean completely break up but some time for both of you to think it over.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I understand how you feel, it's not easy to get over this feeling.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That's why you need some time for yourself to think whether you can forgive him and try to help him or not.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","To be honest, watching porn is normal, however, I feel that if someone is too into it, as in watch it more than 1-2 times a month, it's problematic and won't be easy to fix. Do you live with him?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You can ask him to stop doing that for you, if he really cares, he will try.<|endoftext|>"
Others,goodness.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That you have to ask him, tell him to have an honest thought, no judgement, be completely honest with each other.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Yeah, laughs can definitely be a sign of someone getting nervous. Does he have any close male friends?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Whether he's gay or not, it's hard to say just from a few things, but what's more important right now is for you two to sit down and talk.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I've worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co-workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn't be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You've got this! It's easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key. I hope discussing your work situation today has made you feel a bit better!<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"Well id get your favorite food, pop on your favorite show, and just try to forget about work for now.<|endoftext|>"

Question,What kind of health risks are you concerned about? I imagine that hasn't been easy couple with the tough home environment.<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,I understand how you feel. I'm currently saving up to move out myself because I think it would give me a chance to think for myself.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I don't think you should feel guilty about that because you are looking out for yourself which is the most important thing. And it always helps to voice your feelings to your family. Whether or not they choose to accept it, just getting things off your chest can help too.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","That's good! It's definitely a great thing to look out for yourself rather than trying to please people all the time especially if it makes you feel uncomfortable in the process. You are very welcome, I can relate so I definitely understand where you are coming from.<|endoftext|>"

"Others,Question,Providing Suggestions",I mean you are 29 give me a break . You are very mature and know what makes you happy and you have had some time to explore the world so to speak.  Give me one moment to think of a solution. are they close friends or just friends. Either way have you been able to have a heart  to heart and be like I love xxx and I value our friendship how can we work together to make this work?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"You are absolutely correct with Covid everything is not normal and I am afraid we have to accept this time as the new normal until this all clears up.  Also, it wont do any good to be sad even though you have a right to it is just better to try to be positive. Believe me easier said than not.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure",Do you guys talk on face time or face book or anything social media related? Amen everyone will be so much happier.  May I say something with no disrespect since we just met.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,God is on the throne and in Control . I am not just saying this because it happens to be Sunday. I haven't been to church since March due to Covid. I used to go weekly but that doesn't make me any better or worst than those who don't .  I am just saying prayers help and most people say  nothing left but to pray when it should be our first defense. The other thing that comes to mind is since most of us are home more and we have internet maybe you could think of something to buy under 20 or less but would convey to your friend that you are thinking of them / value your friendship and even though you are with love of your life they can be too!! IF they can't accept this after Covid and you talk face to face I am afraid you can make better friends.<|endoftext|>
Others,Sounds great ! I wish you the best and hope I could bridge the gap. Good luck and Keep safe.<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,Have you tried The Smiths? Band from the 80's. They are my go to for when I am feeling low.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions,Information","To be blindsided is a violation of trust. Have you spoken to her about it at all, or is that not your jam? It's ok. A lot of people are non-confrontational. Society tells us we should be able to express our boundaries. Not everyone is comfortable with that and that is ok.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,But that puts more responsibility on you for your feelings. Sounds like you have coping skills for that.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",You're right. That is not fair. You are feeling conflict and abandoned/not-abandoned. Could you make the decision?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","Only you are responsible for you. I was with someone who, although we had great fun together, he couldn't be with me as much as I wanted him to. And it made me feel bad. Because it brought up feelings from when I was growing up and neglected. It took a long time, and it ...wasn't a clean break. I just got tired of feeling bad, and the relationship just waned. Take the time you need, but you can take control, if you want to.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"Thats a tough cycle. I was in that with my mother. Unfortunately if they do not want to get the help, it wont really go anywhere no matter how hard you try. I would suggest that they try and talk to a professional though. Thats about all you can do. As for yourself, i would focus on you for now, i would try to do something you enjoy. Get your spirits back up.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well reaching out and speaking about it, like you are doing right now, really does help. It can be really difficult to live with someone who has issues like that.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Then i would suggest to talk to a professional as well. It really does help to lay it all out on  the table and try to put the pieces back together.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Not a problem at all. Have you tried maybe going for a walk alone, clearing your mind, seeing where you are at?<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,taking long walks as well. Don't obsess on it.<|endoftext|>
Others,right. stay optimistic.<|endoftext|>
Others,You certainly got your work cut out for you.<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",i know this can be a tough situation but I believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to. do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok. i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about it.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"so your plan is to keep your distance, your friend will eventually see him for who he is.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I would suggest joining  a group like Al-Anon.  It will be goof for you to talk to others in this situation.<|endoftext|>
Others,It is difficult for others to understand unless they are in the situation.<|endoftext|>

Others,ooh okie nice.<|endoftext|>
Others,Good afternoon.<|endoftext|>
Question,Can I ask for a reason why.<|endoftext|>
Question,What is causing you to be sad.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So this is a close friend.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That could cause a sadness.<|endoftext|>
Question,Could it be for a reason you are unaware of.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family.<|endoftext|>
Question,How long has it been since she moved in.<|endoftext|>
Question,have you thought about a housewarming gift.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,So just a week and she is settling in.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style.<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure",Why not text her 1st to break the ice. But maybe she is feeling like she is alone also.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",The virus is stopping people but we can find away. Does she have other family.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,The card could be a nice gift.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Text and ask about her son.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Surprise her with the card 1st. Then follow up with a phone call.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"i can imagine how you are feeling right now, but can you explain better how the situation is?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"i know you might be feeling betrayed right now, a friend should not have behaved like that.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"there should be someone you can try to confined in, i know you did wrong by drinking, but you need to open up to someone, cop your parent or someone you trust.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It fine, he will sure be pissed but its better to meet him lay out the truth, though he might be mad, but that will else up the problem.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,you should talk to your hubby dont be scared.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,it will be a more disaster if he get to know on his own.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"you can, tell your friend, she should be able to help, but you have to tell your hubby.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,he will trust you more only if you confide in him.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,with telling him you can be free from all guilt. with telling him you can be free from all guilt.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"please do, and make sure you stay clear of the friend.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"he isn't a friend worth keeping, you can report him to the appropriate bodies, the cops will do.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That will be great, and make sure you stay off party till the matter is resolved.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It must be very difficult to be a student during this time.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I understand that completely. It's very helpful to speak with people face to face. However, have you sought other ways, such as through Zoom, to interact with peers having the same difficulties?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Classes that involve hands-on work must be very challenging to do online. It sounds like this is a real dilemma. What ways have you already sought to overcome it?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I feel very much the same way. I am also a student taking online classes this semester. I can't wait until we get back to normal classroom settings, and I also hope fervently that the vaccine process is quick, efficient, and effective. I find that making regular online meetings with my professor, while it might not help with the physicality of your work, at least provides mental and motivational boosts. Do you ever meet with them in any capacity?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,It's been the same way at my school. At least there is some solace in knowing that a large group of students is also struggling right now. Having a source of community support/commiseration is at least emotionally helpful.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"If there's only one thing to take from this, it's knowing you aren't alone. I have confidence that you, and this entire country, is going to get through these difficult times.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I definitely get that. It's especially hard because we've had to sit still for so long. It's almost been a year since things were normal. It's kind of like we're just waiting for real life to start again.<|endoftext|>
Others,"That sounds incredible. Or just to be able to go into a store without a mask and hand sanitizer and constantly monitoring how close you are to people. It's almost impossible to imagine, to be honest. But when that day finally comes, it'll be one of the best days of my life. We can finally start putting all of this behind us.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Thanks! I hope this helped relieve some stress, at least. You stay safe, too.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Good afternoon!  What can I help you with today?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Reflection of feelings","Oof, yes, school can be a tough situation.   Are you close to the end of the semester? That can be both a relief and stressful, because a break is near, but all the exams and projects are due.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Ahh, I see.  That is a great deal of time and work.  What are you studying?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Time management can be very difficult with a normal class load, that sounds exhausting.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Do calendars help you at all?  I am a super visual person, so calendars and planners are invaluable to me, as well as different colors of ink and labels so I can visually divide my attention. Getting a million different colors of pens and highlighters changed my organization for the better.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Also, setting clear boundaries for your study/work and relax times may help.  I like to set a timer for, say, 45 minutes, and work/write/read/study for that long, then, I get a 10 minute break.  I'll go outside, refresh my coffee, grab a snack, dance to some music, stretch, then set another timer for 45 minutes, then another break for 10 minutes.  That allows my brain to take a second and refresh from the work.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Or, like, today, I woke up and spent half an hour allowing myself to drink my coffee and scroll through Reddit.  Then it was time to work on my group project for 45 minutes, then a break, then I worked again, took a break, went to a class, etc.  Scheduling your breaks can be helpful too so your lizard brain doesn't freak out and go ""WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING FOREVERRRR"".<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"which, for me at least, is where the fatigue sets in.  You're very welcome!  I hope I was helpful.  You seem positive and willing to try new things, and I think you will be successful even if you are tired.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Definitely not.  Everyone's Maslow hierarchy getting knocked out from under them is extremely disconcerting.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Like how is a person supposed to study, self-actualize, when we literally don't know what will happen next?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Are there aspects of your study that you dislike, or are you just ready to be done with school?  Little of column A + column b?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Ah, yes, that makes sense.  And working from home is infamously hard, again, for lack of boundaries, so in addition to just not seeing people and getting the casual affirmation and confirmation messages on a daily basis of like ""hey Jim you did a great job on that spreadsheet"" or ""Haha Jessica you're so funny"", we also are writing papers in our pajamas and bedclothes, which makes it seem interminable.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Listening to lectures while the doorbell is ringing and it's just so strange and we aren't set up to do it.  That's why I'm a big fan of specific spaces in my house since March.  I tried to sit in bed with my laptop and do things but 1. I'm old and it hurts my wrists and 2. my headspace is so completely different from being my computer chair and at my desk.  I try to be really strict about where I do my work., maybe trying to structure that a bit could help you feel a little more in control of the work load and your day's schedule.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I am very glad to hear that!  You sound motivated to succeed and I think that you deserve to take care of yourself and stay healthy to complete your studies.  It will be hard but it will also be worth it, and you should be proud.  Good luck with everything!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you!  You too!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I see you are looking for some resources on a course that your professor isn't helping you with.  What kind of questions do you have?<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you looking for help to perform better in a certain subject in college?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I didn't see all the specifics but I remember taking that class.  I went to my counselor and got a tutor which helped so much.  It was offered for free at the college.  Do you think you that is something you'd like to check out?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I had a student who was a genius (by my standards) helping me and he was so patient and understanding.  This lessened the pressure and helped me move forward successfully in the class.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Yes, I understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yes, I had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class.  I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that I could rewind and go back to at the time of college.  When I got to grad school, I ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because I could reference the books while listening to a lecture.  That made so much difference.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you are making efforts to do your best to sleep and understand the materials.  You can give yourself a pat on the back for all the great efforts!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Sometimes you have to give yourself more credit because you are doing a good job.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you feel better about the situation?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Great, I hope you keep encouraged and working hard toward your goals because you deserve the very best with your hard work.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Great!  Have a good day.<|endoftext|>
Question,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking. It sounds like you might not be doing okay. Anything you want to talk about?<|endoftext|>"
Question,That sounds like a lot for a person to be dealing with. Is this your husband/boyfriend?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Information",That's a long time. He's lucky to have you to support him. You said you worry when he's not at home. Is this because of the injury and not acting like himself? Supporting someone with a  brain injury can be stressful. Are you taking are of yourself as well? You can't be of help to your boyfriend if you are not doing well yourself.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"If I understand this correctly your boyfriend cheated on you after you had a child together. Now, the other woman is pregnant with your boyfriends baby? Did I get that right?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","I can understand that would make you feel anxious and depressed. Do you have someone to help you cope with this situation? Friends, Family, etc?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information",I totally understand where you are coming from. Things get much more complicated when children are involved.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","Well, it sounds like you still have a lot going on. Sometimes even when you want to take more on emotionally and mentally you need to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation. Maybe finding someone to talk to about everything that is currently going on in your life would be helpful. Youre only human, right?<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions",Agreed. But maybe that's what has to happen to help you get through this. I think it might be a good starting point for you.<|endoftext|>
Information,That's okay. Forgiveness helps us out as well. It helps us to move forward with our lives.<|endoftext|>
Information,It's never easy.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information",Exactly! I hope our chat has helped you out a bit. Maybe even given you some things to reflect on. You always have the power to change the dynamic of the situation. Remember that.<|endoftext|>
Information,You will. It will just take some reflection on your part.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Fantastic! I'm really glad to hear that! Well, I wish you the very best. Enjoy the rest of your night!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you! : ).<|endoftext|>
Question,Im okay how are you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel there. I can definately relate to that...What's going on?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","Wow, that is crazy that is going on, it doesn't seem fair at all... Have you tried going to any higher up? Perhaps in the HR department?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's horrible they would treat the HOSPITAL workers like this, with everything that is going on in the world today.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure",That is a position right there in the line of fire. Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I definitely understand that. Do you want a couple links on dealing with some stress? I personally like to run..<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",I live in Georgia so yes i so run every morning...Great stress reliever. Wow that is cold.. I could not run in that what so ever...Do you have a gym?<|endoftext|>
Question,How are things going on your end?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Awl, I'm sorry to hear that. We all go through those moments when we open ourselves to love others. Time will allow these feelings to pass. I found that break ups make us better in the long run. They show us what we really want and what we dont.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,We are human we are suppose to love that is natural.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can tell that this has really affected you. It is always like that at first.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure",Life will get better for you each day. The healing of the heart and mind takes time but it gets better. That is why I like to keep communication open so that I wont be sprung off guard with a change in relationships.<|endoftext|>
Information,Well sounds like to me he doesn't know how karma works. lol.. The universe makes ways for us to have what we ask for. A closed door is really re-routing you to where you are suppose to be.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Yes, think about what you are grateful for not what you feel like you have lost. No one loses in relationships we just learn and become better people.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,You will look back at this moment and laugh. We always do as women.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear that. When did he break up with you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That seems very cowardly to break up with you over text after being together for a year.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That is a shame. I can understand his perspective if marriage is not something he wanted but it seems hurtful to string you along in  a relationship if your life goals were very different. Was your differing opinions on marriage the only reason he gave?<|endoftext|>
Question,That sounds very difficult. How have you been coping with the break up?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I think this is to be expected from a very fresh break-up. I know that when I broke up with my partner, I spent at least a few days crying and trying to figure out what my life would be now.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I tried to focus on other areas of my life and to critically reflect on my relationship. Largely, I threw myself into my work and tried to better that aspect of my life, and hung out with people that I knew cared about me. Both of those are very good distractions which you might be able to use.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think one day off to get the crying out of your system is a good emotional cleanse. We all need time to self care and look after our emotions. Maybe going for a walk or doing some yoga, to place your focus on something rather than being boxed into a room may help to shift your focus.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You are more than welcome. I hope that you feel better by being outside.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you are not having a good time at the moment? Can you tell me a little more about why?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions",Your wife has been unfaithful to you? I can understand why you are so angry about that! Have the two of you considered counselling or are things beyond redemption now?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I am really sorry to hear that. I do know personally how betrayed you feel when you are cheated on. All I can say is, it does get better.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It sounds like you have been treated very poorly, do you agree with that?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are there potential financial issues or do you think she'd be prepared to reach an amicable settlement?<|endoftext|>
Others,She does not seem to have stayed true to her marriage vows for very long!<|endoftext|>
Information,"Wow that is very difficult. There are support agencies out there that can help the friends and family of addicts, I believe. Would you consider them?<|endoftext|>"
Question,That sounds really very controlling. Do you think that maybe she is regretting her decision but does not know what to do about it?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Sometimes, unfortunately, you do just have to walk away from a mess if there's nothing you can do about it.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I hear you on that. Unfortunately some people do not take commitment as seriously as others. I have been in that position and had my heart broken.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","Oh, I tracked him down and smashed his head in with an axe. Okay no I didn't really. I just told myself that I was better off without him and it was his loss. I am not sure I totally believed myself though. (sorry I had a temporary internet connection problem there).<|endoftext|>"
Others,I would advise not to rush into anything else too quickly. You need to give yourself time to grieve before you move on.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope that I have been able to be of some comfort to you!<|endoftext|>
Others,And you too! Goodbye :).<|endoftext|>
Question,Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings","Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now.What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don't convey the meaning 100 percent.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven't already done so.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn't have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions",That is good to hear. I am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called How to Be Antiracist. It can serve as both learning and bonding purposes. I am glad that I can be of help. Thank you again for reaching out. Hope you adjust better to the changing norm next year and happy holidays.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Question",Hello! How are you today? You are feeling anxious about the future?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure,Self-disclosure","Ok. You are making some assumptions on information you have about your company. Remember that you may not know the whole story. I, too, have made assumptions that affection my outlook and caused anxiety. My assumptions were often wrong.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","Ok. Have you thought about a plan? When you tell your family, it may help to state your planned actions. This may help with feelings of uncertainty, both theirs and yours. When I have been in a similar situation, I started reaching out to my network of friends and coworkers before I was let go.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know. This is the worst time of year for this news. Surprisingly, it happens very often. Having 2 months of savings is FANTASTIC! More than most people.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Do you anticipate any roadblocks to finding new employment in your industry? I understand your feelings. The holidays are a joyous time. No place for uncertainty.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Do you think that outlining a plan of action, and sharing that with your family will help turn this around a bit? Perhaps, think about as looking forward to a better opportunity in your future?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"The stimulus has helped a lot of people get through this tough time. Sounds like you will feel much more secure knowing that you will have some income, and not have to use your savings that you worked so hard for.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"It's a wonderful thing to love your job. I love mine, as well, and would feel bad if it were put at risk.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Your hard work and savings will get you through, no matter what happens or the gods decree. You have demonstrated that you can take care of yourself and your family.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I can say that many friends of mine have found new jobs, most have left their old ones willingly for new opportunities. There are out there.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","Consider making your plan of action, regardless of what happens with the stimulus. THis is an unprecedented time. There may be ways to...use it to your advantage. You, too. Thank you, and take care :-).<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you were really close to your best friend. It can take time to get through the grief of losing someone. Things will get better I promise.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I lost my father when I was 19. That was pretty tough and it took me years to be OK with it. There are still days a decade later where I think about him and miss him.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Time heals all wounds. While that doesn't sound helpful now it is true. I also found focusing on the good experiences I had with my father (or in this case your best friend) helps. Remembering the times where you both were happy.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That's a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don't read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance","Having a bedtime routine is also another tip. Try to do the same thing every night before bed. Have a consistent bedtime, wake up around the same time everyday, even on days that you don't have to go to work. Yes, phone's are tough to give up but soooo many studies show how bad they are for your sleep. I believe in you though, you will get through this.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You are welcome. I am sorry for your loss and I hope for the best for you.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you an investor?<|endoftext|>
Question,I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life.  Has this affected you negatively?<|endoftext|>
Question,What sorts of things?<|endoftext|>
Question,So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety?  Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever?<|endoftext|>
Question,So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you've had a reasonable amount of alcohol?<|endoftext|>
Question,I have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when I was younger and I found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types.  Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?<|endoftext|>
Question,Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks.  Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep...the amount you drink.  Do your friends encourage you to drink more?<|endoftext|>
Question,Are they okay with it when you decline?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on.  That's good that they don't push you too much.  Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions.  I'm sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help...sober fun!  Also if you find that you're struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support.  Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking.  Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others.<|endoftext|>
Others,You have a good day as well!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi, do have any issues that you would like to share with me today?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am sorry to hear that. So, you and your friends are not seeing eye to eye? Do you mind telling me what the issue is that yo are not agreeing on?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That can be difficult and I can relate to that too. When friends do not respond the way that we feel that they should it can be really hard. Do you have any family that you are close with?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I understand the issue of money can cause a lot of problems in a relationship. I had a best friend borrow money once and it lead to her never paying it back and we stopped being friends. Do you plan on trying to talk to your friends soon? Maybe I can give you some advice on how to approach them.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Maybe you could chose a place to meet that is neutral, somewhere at a park or at a cafe. You can ask them to reflect on the good memories in your friendship and then express how you value them as people and friends. Does that sound like something you can try?<|endoftext|>"
Information,That is a good idea too. Having boundaries is the healthiest part of a relationship so that neither party gets taken advantage of. Setting up lines not to cross is a great idea.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I understand that friends can disappoint us sometimes and friendships can take a lot of effort. I would recommend starting a journal. A daily journal can help you express your feelings on paper and it can help you from getting to frustrated and keeping your feelings inside.<|endoftext|>
Information,I am proud of you today because you reached out and have tried to find help outside of yourself. You are growing and trying to do your best.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Yes, you're growing and trying to do your best and wanting to expand your boundaries and make them clear. You have taken the right approach and are on the best track to having a successful relationship in the future. Great Job! Thank you for sharing your story with me today.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You are welcome and here for you anytime. I am able to listen and do my best to help you navigate friendships and other issues too. We are always here.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Hello. I totally understand being stressed out by school. I am currently in a Ph.D. program and it can be overwhelming. Do you have any hobbies to help with your stress?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"It sounds like you do a lot of activities that are solitary. Have you considered maybe partaking in a similar activity, like a book club, where there is more interaction with people?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Being busy, especially with having a small child can make you feel lonely, enhancing the stress you feel from school. Participating in social events geared toward your interest might be able to connect you to people with similar feelings!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sure that you are trying your best to be both a good student and a great parent. It is understandable that you may not have considered those options.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",It is so admirable that you are acting so selfless. Are you aware of any activities that you can participate in that can include your family? It could be the best of both worlds.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Self-disclosure",That is great! Physical activity has been shown to reduce stress levels. My sister-in-law really benefits from having her sons in sports. She is able to connect with the other team moms and considers them some of her best friends. Depending on your YMCA your son may be able to participate in some of their programs?<|endoftext|>
Others,Soccer would be a perfect way for both you and your son to interact with other people of similar interests.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I am glad to help, Hopefully, considering these options will not only reduce your stress from being busy with being a parent and with school, but it will also bring you closer to your child.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Sometimes stress is inevitable. You just have to know how to channel it. Some use physical activity, others use journaling. These seem to be outlets you can consider?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",Physical activity seems to be the option you are most interested in. Have you considered setting daily exercise goals?<|endoftext|>
Information,Having goals for a given day can help motivate you to do the exercises and keep your head cleared from stress.<|endoftext|>
Others,Your welcome.<|endoftext|>
Question,How are you?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed. Would you like to tell me what's going on?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety. May I ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?<|endoftext|>
Question,What was you're score?<|endoftext|>
Others,"That isn't TECHNICALLY a failed grade by the standards of most professors. Albeit a low grade, it's a D. Anything below 59% would qualify as failed.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you done fairly well in other classes? How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Reflection of feelings","I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that YOU can help. By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise...<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,OMGoodness no kidding. This whole pandemic has the world in a tizzy!<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","If I were you I would not wait! It may not be the best option for your learning style, and it will certainly prove a greater challenge. However, taking on that challenge will bring on SWEETER rewards when you succeed! Adopt a ""Can-Do"" state of mind and grab the bull by the horns! You're so very welcome!<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hello, how are you doing?<|endoftext|>"
Others,I am okay. Windy day here.<|endoftext|>
Information,Please tell me about it.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I had that tendency too, work was very important to me, sometimes to the detriment of my relationships. Tell me more about the lack of closeness. What's different?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is there any way to speak to them directly about how you feel about that time... tell them what your feeling. People who care for you can be very understanding.<|endoftext|>
Information,You don't have to make a big deal about it but I have found that a low key discussion can change things for the better.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Plus at least you will have stated how you feel and no matter the outcome you can feel like it's been addressed.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have found that if something has been bothering me, just dealing with it somehow will make me feel better and enable me to get on with the good aspects of my life.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Good luck. A friend of mine used to say ""action alleviates anxiety"" and Ive found that helpful.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Others","That is extremely understandable.  The pandemic is an event no one was prepared for, and it has cause unforseen upheavals. That is a tough situation, being isolated physically from those that you love.  I'm sorry you're going through that.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Are you at least able to maintain contact through text and video chats?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","Well, I make sure I continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues I have available.  It is definitely not the same, but it's what we have at the moment. Personally, I try to maintain a routine.  First hour after I wake up is coffee time, coffee and social media scroll time.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"That sounds very stressful, I'm sorry to hear that.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I definitely cannot answer that.  As long as people keep valuing one another though, we will get through it.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Of course, that's understandable.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sorry to hear your sad. Is there anything I can do to help you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Sure, let's talk it out.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's a valid concern and overwhelming to think about I'm sure. What is her prognosis?<|endoftext|>
Others,And is this something that she will die early because of?<|endoftext|>
Information,So if she manages it she can live a relatively normal life?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Sure, I can see where it would be challenging and pregnancy would be scary. But I'd suggest discuss it with her doctor to see what they suggest.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"As hard as it is to think about, you'd also have a piece of her.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Do you simply not want kids? Because if she does and you don't, you can't blame it on her condition, that would be making her give up something that wouldn't be fair.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I understand, you may need to have a hard conversation with her.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Maybe you're not right for each other if you have such different views on this subject. Neither one of you should have to give in to something they don't want.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","Unfortunately it sounds like you've had a lot of experience with that, and I can understand that. I've been to my fair share as well. But you also can't live your life in fear or you're not really living. Unfortunately it sounds like you've had a lot of experience with that, and I can understand that. I've been to my fair share as well. But you also can't live your life in fear or you're not really living. Or allowing her to live the life she wants as well.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. It sounds like you have someone who cares about you and wants a part of you to exist in another living being. I know you're scared and that's valid, but you have an opportunity to do things differently than what your mom did for you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"But having gone through that yourself, you know exactly what NOT to do.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Then it must be good advice lol.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You deserve better than thinking your feelings don't count for something. There are people that love you and want to listen and be a part of your life.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Good, I'm glad you have that support.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you, I'm glad I was able to chat with you and wish you the best!<|endoftext|>"
Others,You as well!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed. Do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,If i were you i would call your friend maybe she has some suggestions of things you could do based off of your skills.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Yea and if not it wont have hurt to talk to her about it and all of the worry off your mind.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It does not hurt to try. Maybe call her and tell her you have some things on your mind and could use some advice from her if it is not to much of a bother.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","I'm sorry to hear that. These are trying times. Is there anything specific making you feel so down? I'm doing okay today, thank you for asking.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I can empathize a bit. I lost mine earlier this year due to covid, but they did bring us back.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sorry. It can definitely be difficult finding a new job, especially these days.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Have you updated your resume? I always forget to update mine when I'm job searching. I leave out so much important information!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That might be good. Try to include all those little details about what you did, even if it doesn't seem significant. I think it shows flexibility and willingness to like cross train and learn new skills.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's definitely a good way to save money, and I think the homemade gifts are more meaningful and full of love, anyway.And yes, of course!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh, I'm sure it will! Just knowing that you took the time and made the effort to make something personal for them is amazing!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I honestly don't know. Cover letters are weird, I never know how to do them correctly lol I don't know if they're there just to make sure you're following directions or if they're actually important. I like to think someone does, but I'm really not sure.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Applications are so weird! Why do I want to work here? Um, because these bills won't pay themselves lol.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Others",I think that's a good strategy. I think it would probably get more attention on your actual resume - there's probably more of a chance of it actually getting read lol. It seems like the resume itself is more important than the cover letter.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it's too late.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn't his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that's something he would do?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"nobody likes to see that one's friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back.<|endoftext|>"
Information,what made you like someone else in the first place?<|endoftext|>
Question,was it a common thing that he didn't give you the attention you wanted?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,were you happy with him or were you happy that you were with the popular guy?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"it sounds to me like you liked the title more than the feeling of being with him, reflecting on your time together, would you do that again?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"popularity in my opinion, it's just an opinion (I hope I make sense) but think about how you'd like to be treated and how you want to feel when you are with someone, because at the end of the day it's your feelings and your happiness, I wish you the best of luck.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I hear you need someone to talk to. What is your situation at your work?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Being stressed and anxious is something I've experienced as well. I use breathing to help keep me centered, calm.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Restatement or Paraphrasing","That sounds tough. Just from chatting with you, I can feel how anxious you are. It sounds like you don't feel heard by your boss.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I have also felt unfairly treated at a workplace. Have you tried to talk to a human resources director or a company hotline?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I believe you deserve to be treated fairly. I hear that you also believe that you deserve to be treated fairly. Calling a hotline or talking to a human resource profession is a suggestion.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Expressing your feelings about the companies redundancies. Also, your feelings about the company having no communication or empathy for their employees.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome. I hope this message finds you well.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"In combination with breathing, I suggest using a thought map to clear your mind. Also going for a walk can help you with your mental or emotional health.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,How are things going for you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Okay, with some job anxiety, Would you be willing to say more about that?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Woah. Blessings to you for existing in what sounds like a stressful situation. How is self care going during this?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Heck yeah! You're worth it! Thats great that you do those things for yourself. Is there anything you want to have happen here?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question","But of course! Tell me, what gold would you say you have reaped from this year? What goodness or strength have you discovered?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Go you! Sounds like you've really found some gifts in all this hardship. What are some things that have brought you joy today?<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,Sometimes I find that when I am doing less I end up being more exhausted.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Have you been spending any time outside or exercising?  Science has shown that boost of endorphins you get from sunlight or exercise can help with energy. I understand that it is easy to stay in bed all day until you absolutely have to do something.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Not having motivation is a tough feeling to overcome.  I think a lot of people are suffering with this issue due to todays current affairs.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you think it could help you if you tried to spend some more time outside or exercising?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Even if you just do something easy like a walk around the block.  Or sit in front of a window while the sun floods in on you.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","I try to make sure that on sunny days I open all of my blinds.  It forces me to get out of bed, and the vitamin D boost from the sunshine helps to keep me motivated. It sounds like you may be identifying some things that you could change?<|endoftext|>"
Others,That's great!  I am glad to help.  I am confident that you can overcome this time.<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",That has to be frustrating. It sounds like you are angry. How long ago did all of this happen?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like he meant a lot to you!<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you want to talk to him again?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,What if you wrote him an email? Would that help?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am so sorry. What would help you right now in this moment?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I know when I cry it sometimes helps me.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It takes time. You're grieving. It's hard. What about disconnecting from what he does?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"It sounds like every time you find out something he is doing, it's hurting you even more.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,Ok. Just click the red finalize and exit button to end the therapy session.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",That is very understandable.  Depression is tough to deal with. Do you have specific things that are causing you sadness right now or is it an overall feeling of being sad?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","I totally understand.  Losing your job is a very rough thing to go through, I'm sorry that happened to you.  Feeling constantly at red alert is taxing both mentally and physically. There is a concept called Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes I find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking.  Which is to say, obviously financial security is your primary need at the moment, but there are other needs you must attend to as well, including your physical comforts. In times of great stress and upheaval, there is only so much you can do.  The rest is worry, a hamster running in a wheel, a huge output of energy that does nothing at all.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That makes sense.  You sound emotionally exhausted.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Gratitude is one of those things, I've found, that is self-perpetuating.  Even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful.  I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down.  Whether those things are ""I have hot coffee and electricity"" or ""I won $1000 for free"", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That sounds like a great idea!  It sounds like you care a lot about your kids, I bet it's easy for you to be grateful for them :-). And I know that they are grateful for you, whether they are able to articulate that or not.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well that is an enormous amount of responsibility that has been placed upon your shoulders, but your attitude seems extremely pleasant and positive.  It does not sound easy, but you should make sure you build in some time for yourself if you can.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You definitely have options, but your situation is still tough, and you deserve relief where you can get it.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Of course, I am happy if I was able to help.  You have a good heart and love your kids, you stay strong, you can do this :-).<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,so I hear you are not feeling at all your best at the moment?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you feel as though you have no-one to talk to about this situation? I am happy to listen.<|endoftext|>
Others,Do you have no idea? Do you think you might have done something wrong or perhaps she was being unfaithful to you?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you consider that there might be any hope for the  two of you at all?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, I think you should give her some space but people do sometimes get back together after they've separated.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You really do need to give her some space though - don't crowd her.<|endoftext|>
Others,I would give her a little time. Maybe two or three days? She might need some time to clear her head.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you could send flowers and a note asking her if she'd like to talk?<|endoftext|>
Others,She might be feeling receptive to that but if she's not you might have to accept that it's over.<|endoftext|>
Question,How can I help?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm so sorry to hear that.<|endoftext|>
Question,How long were you together?<|endoftext|>
Question,That's tough. Can you describe what events led to the breakup?<|endoftext|>
Information,How do you think you will get through this?  Do you have someone to talk with?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It absolutely will take time. You are right. Can I suggest that you try to look at what went wrong before getting involved with someone else? Would it be possible to talk with your friends and family about what they think might have happened?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I'm sure it will help to be with people who love you when you feeling so devastated.<|endoftext|>
Information,I hear you. All messages this time of year are about being with people we love and that will hit you hard at this time of year. Do you have any particular things you like to do to take care of yourself?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Yes. when you are depressed it is hard to become motivated to do anything. However, it is extremely important that you do act. Keep moving through your days, even if you feel like you are in a haze. It may take awhile to build up to snowboarding. Maybe start with a daily walk and build from there. Action (physically doing something) triggers psychological movement. It will help you move through the pain that you are feeling.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Thank you so much for asking for help.  It has been so nice talking with you. Take care and know that in time this pain you are feeling will become less and less intense. Have a great rest of your week!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Oh I am so sorry to hear that - this is a terrible time of year to get dumped. Please know that it will get better in time!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Well, although it sounds like a cliche, time does help with healing wounds. It took me a while to get over a break up. We had been together eight years!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yes I think that it is but you really do need to be kind to yourself and give it time. Do you have good friends to support you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That is a blessing at least though I know it can be hard to see people in happy relationships when you are single.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I cried a lot to be honest, especially as he was happy with someone else. But I tried to focus on my work and my hobbies. It helped.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Well I love to read. Do you have anything that you could do to help you relax  and take your mind off things?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you and she have any contact at all at the moment?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Do you feel that perhaps you did not treat her as well as you could have done?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, you have at least learned a lesson and in the future will treat women better I think :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Quite! It's all a learning experience in the end. Maybe you should talk to someone about it? A professional counsellor?<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope I have been able to give you some things to think about :). Take care and Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything you'd like to talk about today?<|endoftext|>
Question,Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed??<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you!<|endoftext|>
Information,There are resources online that perhaps you could look into to help with expressing yourself.<|endoftext|>
Others,Yes just a moment.<|endoftext|>
Information,I was going to send you a few links but it wont let me.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,healthyplace.com has a good article.<|endoftext|>
Others,Im hope that i have been able to help at least a little bit.<|endoftext|>

Information,Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing. I would try to see if there is something going on in her life right now for her to be acting like this. Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship.

It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Very true, this year made everyone's expectations and plans go out the window lol.

That way, you have some common ground to work with.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's understandable, especially with how the past year has been. Everyone is on edge and everything feels so uncertain, but that's okay, because you're not alone =). You said you're doing well so far? Take pride in that, and focus on that. ""If I've been doing well so far, I must be doing something right. I'll just keep doing what I have been, and everything should work out in the end."".<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","We can be our own worst critics, and that's never been truer than when we're facing a challenge. Self-doubt can be such a pain, but when I find I'm having trouble believing in myself and working toward my goals, I'll focus on what I already accomplished, and that helps give me that extra push to keep going. I might be an internet stranger, but I'm proud of you, too. =) You've got one and a half semesters to go! You've got this! I believe in you! <3.<|endoftext|>"

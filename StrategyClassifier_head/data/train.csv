Question,Hello.  How's it going?<|endoftext|>
Question,I can agree.  There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago.  Which state do you live in?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I agree it's bad!  Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again.  I just keep thinking this is temporary!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.  With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat.  Are you able to hang out with friends?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Oh very much so!  Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now.  lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I downloaded Zoom around the end of May.  The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call.  It was so much fun despite the fact. Maybe organizing a ""zoom party"" would start to lift your spirits.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.  Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom. Most definitely.  Do you have Meetup over there?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself.  Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups.  I do it with a book club.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Totally free!<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,Don't put yourself down! That is a really bad habit to get into when job hunting but i know how easy it is to do.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,I've done a fair bit of it before ... there are good and bad aspects. You get to go to a lot of different places but it's also difficult to make friends and get settled.<|endoftext|>
Information,Me too. But the upside is you can pretty much choose your own hours.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,To be honest it was not all that easy. I tended  to keep my head down a lot and just smile vaguely when someone made eye contact.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,What about something that involves less physical contact? There's always gig work online.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I work on Amazon Mechanical Turk - if you're diligent you can make a fair few bucks there. Not sure it's a living wage though but you could try it.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,I do understand. It's really hard. THe only thing that you can do is try to stay positive as cliche as that sounds.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",You aren't helpless! So much of this is mental and you being there for him is more helpful than you know. Will you be able to visit him in the hospital?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance",Thank god! That will make such a big difference for both of you. Being alone would be scary. Well he clearly loves you! I am happy that he's getting the treatment he needs and has someone so supportive like you helping him.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","Your friends probably want to be there for you, don't be stressed about that. They just may need some guidance on how to be there for you . My mom is doing great! Still in treatment but doing so well.<|endoftext|>"

"Others,Providing Suggestions",Where are you that you are able to be evicted? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well the plus side is they cannot kick you out right now. Have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement. Have you tried applying for any job?  Now is not the time for pride to get in the way, i would accept anything.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions",I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Your landlord. I worked out a way with payments when i was furloughed from my job. And yes i was actually homeless many years ago so i do know what it feels like to miss out on meals for a days at a time. It seems you should look up evictions during Covid. They are not allowed to throw you on the street as long as the pandemic is going on.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Information",Oh for my situation it was 100% my fault i was in a bad place during that time. I spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me. Bounced around shelters after i sold my car. Washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems. May i ask what state you are in?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others","I was going to paste a link for you on evictions during covid. Please just google Evictions during covid (your state) you will find groups that can help and the laws, that are on your side. I hope you can overcome this, i know you will.<|endoftext|>"

Information,I care.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Just from chatting with you, I can feel how sad you are about life and maybe a little overwhelmed with what the next step of life is.<|endoftext|>"

"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Take a deep breathe and think about any happy memories. If you are sad right now, the only way is up from here! I believe no one is useless. We were all brought on this earth for a reason.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Like I said, I used to be sad too and not optimistic. But now I am optimistic because I know what it is like to be sad, and I don't want others to feel how I have felt in the past.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Have you tried to express your feelings in one way or another? If you don't want to talk to others, there is always other ways - such as writing, music, etc. Have you tried any different ways? Or would you be open to trying any of those different options?<|endoftext|>"

Question,And how did she break your heart?<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,From talking with you I can tell this has been a real blow and need to find a way to move on.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I've had that happen before to me a few times.  It's just the absolute worst feeling.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,I understand I felt that way when trying to find new opportunities for myself. I kept looking and tried to apply the skills I learned to fit into the new requirements. Maybe a call representative. i assume from previous experience you have excellent customer service skills.<|endoftext|>
Information,From that answer i believe that job could be a good fit!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,With Covid I also lost my job. I looked online and it is currently a field I am pursuing. I don't do call center work but i do social media marketing all from the comfort of my home.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,"Don't worry, that's totally normal, especially since a lot of things are online these days. I personally struggled with keeping up with courses, but I found a way to make it work by pushing to the limits.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I suggest starting with what you missed first instead of worrying what you're getting now. Maybe let your teacher/professor know how you're doing in class and you may be able to ask for extensions on deadlines.<|endoftext|>

Information,Do you know that there are people out there who can help you? Have you tried contacting some charitable organisations that will provide counselling for free?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,They can be really very helpful. I have reached out to them myself previously.<|endoftext|>
Others,The job market is very uncertain right now but please know that you are not alone!<|endoftext|>

"Others,Providing Suggestions,Providing Suggestions","What kinds of things do you think might help with that? Could you meet for lunch or coffee now and then? Or could you all create a standing ""group chat"" to touch base regularly?<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing","Cool! But I gather that if you already do that, you don't think that would be enough? Or would it? What else might work? Ah, so you think that being on different shifts may be what has you all concerned about losing touch?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Is there some overlap between the end of your day shift and the beginning of their night shift? Is there a time you are all awake? Maybe dinner for you, but ""breakfast"" for them?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What else might minimize the separation? Do you all have weekends off?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"So maybe the ""between shifts"" type meeting may help? It might be hard to schedule, but I think you can do that. What do you think?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"So, if the ""gang"" can stay together, what's got you nervous about the new position?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Oh?  How come so tired?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Oh I have had trouble sleeping before!   Would you like to know what helped me?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"First of all, fixed sleep and wake times.   If you toss and turn for hours, still get up at the same time.   Eventually your body will tire and sleeping will naturally become easier.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Second thing I do is I have a wind down routine.   No work past a certain time, no matter what.   Only soft music, pleasant movie, some light reading, and dim the lights.   It slows your body down before sleep.  It will help slow that racing thoughts you are having.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",I have had racing thoughts and it used to drive me up the wall! Can you buy a lamp?  Even a second hand one if your budget is tight?<|endoftext|>
Information,The bright light will keep your mind stimulated.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions","Aw so you are so exhausted from racing thoughts and not enough sleep the night before that you end up taking it out on others, but not meaning to.  Am I understanding correctly? Do you get any exercise?  I sleep better on days I go for walks, and my sedentary days I sleep worse, it's quite clear to me.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Good effort, keep it up! Back pain, I know all about that too unfortunately.  How is your mattress?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Hmm I can't recall, I can't afford to replace mine regularly enough lol.  Maybe google it?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Do you have someone to talk to about the thoughts that are racing? If they are worries, maybe a counsellor would help.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Hmm that's a challenge not having friends.   Have been there too!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I don't want to give you a huge barrage of suggestions but another thing that helps me is a podcast called Tracks to Relax.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Well maybe you just haven't met the right people yet.  It takes time finding someone we click with.<|endoftext|>
Others,"It's probably not you!   When people drift away from me I always say to myself ""Oh well, their loss!"". you're welcome bye and i hope things improve soon.  You WILL get through this!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"My pleasure, I've enjoyed talking with you.<|endoftext|>"

"Providing Suggestions,Information","i get it, its hard to relax and get away from it. i been trying to keep busy and stay away from the news as much as can. yes its very weird. got to stay strong!<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure",it will end one day and well be relieved. yea try to fill yourself with positive news or watch a movie read a book stay off social media abit helps me. music helps me alot.<|endoftext|>

Others,YAY! <3.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,anytime and best of luck to you !<|endoftext|>
Question,It seems like things have not be great for you over the past couple of weeks. Why do you feel they have been worse?<|endoftext|>
Question,That seems like a frustrating experience. What were your expectations of the session you were supposed to have? Did you feel like what you learned in your previous session would have helped you with dealing with what you typically work on in your mental health sessions.?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think that is definitely one way to look at it. But another way to look at your situation is you figured out a therapist who isn't worth seeing. That brings you one step closer to finding one who does actually help you. All you need to do now, is do some research and find someone who has your best interest in mind. Believe me, there are great therapists and terrible therapists. You just need to find one of the good ones now.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved. When I was younger and struggling, this had happened to me and I received both of these benefits and it totally turned my life around. I think it can do the same for you as well.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Sure thing. What are some of the coping strategies you've been practicing with your prior therapist?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I can see how that comment he made would be frustrating. If you feel like vaping, you should continue to do; however, what happens if say you go somewhere and find yourself in a stressful position? What would be strategy you could use in order to recenter yourself? Strategies are important as they balance us when we experience stressors that through us off. Have you ever thought about meditation?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Oh yes. Me personally, I like to scour youtube and find an environment with a sound I enjoy such as the beach. When I listen to that sound, I try to put myself by closing my eyes while sitting on the floor and breathing deeply for some time. It may be worth a try for you. I hope it helps you. Good luck!<|endoftext|>"
Others,I wish you all the best!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Yes, what can I do for you?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It's fine here, I just got your message. Please tell me more about your issue.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question",that really sucks how they pulled that excuse on you. did your other friend tell you why they did that?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's understandable for you to feel doubtful. I would give them another chance, suggesting a virtual happy hour and see what they say now hat they no longer have covid excuse.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,you can never know people until something happens.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Just give it a try, if all of them have some excuses again, it's time to stop socializing with those friends. exactly, it's frustrating but at the same time, a blessing in disguise. Through this you know who actually care about you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"yeah, if they don't care about you, why waste your time on them? Spend that time on treating yourself a good meal or a great movie.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"you too, i hope you feel better.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hi. How are you today?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,it's really a terrible time.  you are definitely not alone in feeling that way.  Is there something specific going on?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Is there a way you can write down in an email why the extra work is required and what specifically needs to get done in order to make this project successful for both you and your manager?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have had managers like that.  It's so frustrating.  Is there a way you can have an in-person meeting and show her how extra help will make HER look good?  Otherwise what I've done in the past is go over my immediate manager's head - or called a meeting with 3 of us. I have had managers like that.  It's so frustrating.

Otherwise what I've done in the past is go over my immediate manager's head - or called a meeting with 3 of us.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I feel for you because I've been there and I completely understand how you feel.  And yes including HER and her manager won't make her feel as though you're going behind her back.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance",ridiculing you how?  that's never ok. you have every right to feel upset about that.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I wonder why HR isn't interested.  Have you put it in writing?  No one likes a paper trail that isn't acknowledged.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Information",that has to be a horrible feeling to be in such a hostile work environment.  do you have coworkers who would be willing to back you up? there's definitely power in numbers!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,if it's really that bad is there a way to get a transfer?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,yes and that just makes things so much worse.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,maybe seek out someone more senior in a different department who can help.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,When I had a toxic manager I went in and did my work and kept to myself as much as possible.   But it does help to have allies throughout the company too!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,you're very welcome.  I definitely understand what you're dealing with!<|endoftext|>
Others,"you, too.  enjoy the rest of the weekend!<|endoftext|>"
Question,What's on your mind?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,We are on the same boat.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand how you feel. I think others feel the same too, that we're exhausted no matter if we're directly  affected or not.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"It saddens me too because even when we have vaccines, the damage has been done and the aftermath is unimaginable.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can you tell me why not?<|endoftext|>
Others,"You should still take it though. What done is done, the new vaccine will help situation not getting worse.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I thin it's rushed because people trying to push it so they voided some troublesome paperwork stage.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Frontliners will get it first, you don't have to worry too much about the vaccine.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Then you should be relieved since the sooner they  get the vaccine, the less worry for your family.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's ok to feel doubtful about it, you can keep wearing mask and social distancing and take the vaccine when you feel ready.<|endoftext|>"
Others,We need to put an end to this and vaccine is the fastest way. It's gonna take very long to find treatment.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",Hello. I am so sorry to hear that. I am unable to depend on my family as well. Did you have an unexpected expense? I have been looking for ways to make extra money as well... I completely understand how you feel in that aspect. Times are hard and stressful.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Providing Suggestions",Are you in school and working at the same time? What have you found recently to make extra money? I have just started using ibotta for my groceries... its not much but once i think ive finally got it figured out. I've been on reddit the past few days looking for websites like mturk but I havent tried any that i feel compare yet.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and excluded by your family, I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I have tried pinecone, focus group, and a few others. none compare to mturk in my opinion. How long have you been using mturk? it definitely gets better with time. I'm still figuring it out but it has helped more than anything else i've tried. Did your family say why they wont help you out? maybe they are just unable to.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",Do you still live with them? Sometimes our own family takes advantage of us without meaning to. I'm sure that makes you feel unappreciated. It's surveys... I think that one is supposed to be 3$ each but i've never qualified for one. Most that claim to be higher paying just ask you tons of questions and then say you dont qualify.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,i saw one i'm going to try let me look up the name of it.. a lot of people were talking about it on an mturk forum saying positive things.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information","Ok heres a few I am going to look into that i saw people talking about... microworker, clickworker, crowdsource. Reddit has helped me learn how to earn more on mturk.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Others","yeah I have learned a lot by reading other peoples questions and suggestions. Things I wouldnt have even thought of. I know times are hard, I hope you can find some extra income and appreciation from your family.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome. Good luck!<|endoftext|>
Question,Tell me about the situation that you are facing.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance",I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Tell me more about it if you don't mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking?<|endoftext|>"
Others,I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position?<|endoftext|>
Information,"I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don't mind the location, I am sure you would  be a good fit for these.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied (with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies  that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Others","I hope I can be more helpful. I really sympathize with your situation. They would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis. In rare situations, they would hire ""temp-to-hire"" with the expectation of hiring temp workers.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you for reaching out. It really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal. I hope you succeed.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Happy holidays and best wishes to you.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello Doing good. How are doing?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Sorry to hear this,have you ever tried selling on Ebay.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Have you ever heard of QVC liquidations,its awesome with some very good returns.<|endoftext|>"
Question,If your interested you will need to submit a sellers I.D. or tax id.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Absolutely.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I have made close to 12,000.00 in one year just reselling the returns.Also ESTY is  also a great place.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Go to EBAY and scroll down to the the completed section and click it and this will show you the item your searching like homemade items or stuff like back packs that maybe on sell at Walmart and I buy them and see what they are selling for.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I have purchased a lot of stuff from walmart and resold it on EBAY. Its fun.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Down load the Walmart app and when you go scan the item with app and sometimes its cheaper.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I saw a seller on EBAY make small surf boards and sold them on EBAY well over a hundred dollars.They were 48 inches long but he made good money.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,He painted them and they looked awesome.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,You too.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Hey there! That's a good topic to talk about. With everything that's been going on, it's normal to feel some anxiety. What do you think is one thing that is giving you a lot of anxiety?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sorry to hear that. Similar stuff is happening where I am, and I also get anxious hearing about it.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","What do you feel when you feel on guard and paranoid? Try to say some more about that if you can. Thanks, I hope the same for you.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so.But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives. Well said. You feel stuck. The usual things you would do now are just not available to you.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think you explained yourself really well. Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Yeah, and that just throws on another layer of why things are difficult right now. No one wants to feel guilty for doing things that could help themselves.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Have you ever heard of the phrase ""black or white thinking?"" As in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yeah, I think I understand that too. I get really frustrated hearing about people hosting big parties or not wearing masks because they think it's no big deal. They're putting others at risk.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I think we all do black-or-white thinking to some extent. We're wired to try and make sense of the world, and maybe our brains don't like to spend time on nuance and grey areas. We all tend to quickly categorize things into good or bad, easy or hard, black or white.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Does this time have to be a ""waste"" for you? With no productivity? That seems pretty extreme.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Thanks for saying that! I liked talking with you, and we can wrap this up. I guess I'm saying you sound thoughtful and intelligent, I'm confident that you could find ways to get more out of this time if that's what you're wanting to do.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Not as productive? Of course! It's a pandemic. We all are.  :)    Hope you're not too hard on yourself right now.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Ha, exactly. Maybe we're not all thriving and getting rich and adding 15 pounds of muscle during this time. But we can get through it.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Before we quit, would you want to say one specific thing you know you can do today to help yourself out?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Nice! Good job with those things.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Right on, same to you. It's okay to feel anxious right now. It's okay to feel unproductive right now. It's also okay to keep on doing the things that make you feel okay. Great job keeping up the workouts and the classes.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Stay well and safe to you too! Take care.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I am really sorry to hear that - I've been there too. Can you tell me more?<|endoftext|>
Question,That sucks. Has the pandemic been making your financial situation worse?<|endoftext|>
Information,There is government help available for people who are financially suffering I believe - have you looked into this?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I am really sorry. Is she able to get any other sort of work, even if it's less well paid?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you have any friends or family who might be able to help?<|endoftext|>
Question,That is a dilemma. What sort of field did your wife work in?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Has she considered temping? I did that when I was between permanent jobs and it was quite good.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It's not as well paid but you can choose your own hours. There's also online gig work out there too.<|endoftext|>
Information,Have you considered going to a food bank? They can be very useful.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,You should not feel bad. Have you not donated to food banks yourself when times were better? I used a food bank in a crisis time and now I give back whenever I go shopping.<|endoftext|>
Others,Everyone needs help sometimes :) And you can pass it forward when things are better for you. On that note I suppose I had better go but I was glad to speak with you!<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",goodbye and good luck :). Can you press quit and take the survey? It has to be done by your first :).<|endoftext|>
Others,"I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it's hard to accept but I 'd recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","I'm sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don't feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It's not gonna be easy, but at the same time not impossible. Try looking at it a different way. You can use this time to train your skills or do things that you've wanted to but didn't have the time.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others","that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind.<|endoftext|>"
Question,what have you been doing lately?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","that's a great idea, cooking and doing crafts can be helpful for you. Instead of complaining with others, you can just invite them to join cooking with you, that way you can have companion.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,you can do video chat while cooking. I do virtual happy hour with my friends right now too.<|endoftext|>
Others,haha good idea.<|endoftext|>
Others,"you too, i hope things get better for yourself.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Hello, how are you today.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Do you know how long he has been off his meds?  Does he need help getting a refill?  It can be hard to no our ""normal"" things when we don't feel; that's for sure.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If you are that worried about him, it does sound pretty severe, it may be time to call someone to get him help.  Like his doctor or someone from the hospital.<|endoftext|>"
Information,We definitely don't want him to hurt himself or someone else. We definitely don't want him to hurt himself or someone else.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance",Has his sister seen this kind of replace before?  And if so how did they address it then? That is a really hard place to be.  His doctors phone number is probably on his prescription bottle.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"The doctor may not be able to get him in the office, but they would have his records and also be able to connect you to a facility to could maybe help him since the hospital can't.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can imagine, I'm worried now too and I don't even know your friend. I really hope you keep me updated on how things go.<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance","You're so welcome.  So it sounds like you'll call the doctor office (once you get the number) but please let me know if I can help any other way. lol, very true they do not.  :).<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","you're so welcome.  glad I could help. It's really sad, your friend is lucky to have you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,you as well.<|endoftext|>
Question,"They did not, what is causing your depression and anxiety?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So just to clarify, you are having overwhelming depression and anxiety today that has been caused by nothing in particular?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I completely understand, I have had many issues in the past with anxiety and depression.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Have you tried to talk to a professional about this, it is always helpful to talk to someone who is trained to talk about things like this with people.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What suggestions did they give you for coping with this?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,One thing that I did was really get back into some of the hobbies that I enjoyed in order to take my mind off of things.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes, winter months are very tough.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Not a problem! I know things are tough right now, but I know you can make it through this!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you, I am well. It is a very strange time.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You too!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Good afternoon, how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I am well thank you, how can I help you this afternoon?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Oh no, I am so sorry you are feeling like this. What is bothering you?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Yes, it is very hard during this time and your feelings are valid. What are some ways that you have searched?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I understand. That will happen and it isnt anything personal. You have to stay positive. Do you have an updated resume?<|endoftext|>
Information,"That is a blessing in itself, having a daughter and being a mom. I know you are a great mom! Have you tried some online courses that may give you a little more experience?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I totally understand that. There are some free courses online that can be used or perhaps going in person (staying as safe as possible) into your local food store, clothing  or pet store and having a chat with the manager.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"The masks make a lot of people claustrophobic so i know how you feel but the good thing is that you're wearing it and staying safe for you and your daughter. I feel like working from home is everyone's ideal dream job and those are out there as well, they may just take a little longer to find.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried yoga exercises or meditation? That sometimes helps to clear and refresh the mind.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Thats ok as long as you try doing it, eventually you'll be perfect at it. Is that what you do when you're feeling down and out?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I am so happy to hear that. You are wonderful and you have a little person that needs you. Things are going to get better, just make sure you remember to stay positive.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you very much. You as well. Smile and have a wonderful day!<|endoftext|>
Question,I am okay thanks. Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about right now?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It sounds to me like you are suffering from depression. That sounds scary but it really is common. Would you consider professional help?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,That definitely does sound like depression to me. I have been there myself and I promise you that there is help available.<|endoftext|>
Question,I guess that the pandemic has not helped at all with things?<|endoftext|>
Information,Can't have improved the situation though. Do you know that there are many free counselling services out there that you could utilise?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I hear you - I found it very difficult to go to counselling too but when I did I found it very helpful.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","I do not have any easy suggestions. It took me a good deal of time to be brave enough too. But you can ask yourself - can't things only get better? Or even if they don't, you don't really have anything to lose :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,I hope you can too :). I wish you all the best in the future. (can you press quit first - I can't do it from my end :)).<|endoftext|>

Question,Im sorry to hear that. Have you tried to help it or see a doctor?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Do you feel anxious though? maybe the doctor is right and maybe loosing stress is the answer :).<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Yeah the pandemic hit badly there. I am sorry for your loss. Perhaps you just dont want to follow in the same pathway which is why you are stressed.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Yh thats seems like quite a lot and I know how you feel because of when I was a student. If i made it through you can too!  try your best.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,If you dont take it you might never feel better. I would advice you to take it and see how you feel after.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Yeah i have taken antidepressant when I had my son as I always needed to provide, and I can say it did help me get better.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What's your problem?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is this because of something he does or you are experiencing angry issue with everything?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure","So from what I understand, you think your anger is because of your husband's fault. Have you talked to him about his behavior? I am female.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That's gross. I can't believe he said all those things to you. I'm sorry you have to hear those words from your husband.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You need to stand up for yourself. I know it's difficult and as you said, won't even do any good. However, if you keep your silence, he'd think it's okay to treat you that way because he has power over you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I'd advise you to disclose this to a family member and have them with you (on the phone) when he starts talking like that. that way the other person can call him off.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Others","if you want, you can talk to him one last time and let him know it's enough. I fhe doesn't change, you will cut off with him. You have to stand up for you self first before expecting him to do that.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"If he intimidates you, you should practice what to say and then do the talk in public or when someone else is around. I believe you can do it.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I hope you at least will be able to settle with your husband.<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you ever threatened to leave him?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Then you should do it for real this time and see if he changes.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,The mom always has an upper hand in these issues.<|endoftext|>
Others,You should also have photos of clean house to prove against him.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"as for depression, as long as you have proof youre seeking treatment, you should be fine.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"do it secretly, behind his back.<|endoftext|>"
Others,it all comes down to you have to let him see that you can stand on your own. He's treating you like this because he thinks he can control you.<|endoftext|>
Others,hope you will be fine.<|endoftext|>
Others,What sort of issues are you having? I am happy to listen.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Who is she? A partner, a sister or similar? I am glad you turned her in, whoever she was.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is a really lousy thing for her to have done. I am glad that you did the right thing!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you considered getting a restraining order against her? That should be quite easy to do.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I hope that she would not be informed as to where you live though yes, I understand the dilemma. Have you spoken with the police?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Wow that sounds like it has put you in a bind. I do understand cos once I had to flee from a boyfriend and was scared he would come after me.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you still in contact with her kids? Do you have a good relationship with them?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It might help them a lot to have someone stable in their life though?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You did the right thing. Would you have wanted the girls to end up as addicts, dead or in prison?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you think that perhaps the guilt is not entirely related to your circumstances currently?<|endoftext|>
Others,I know it is difficult but I hope that you can manage to move on from this and find happiness. Thank you for talking and I wish you all the best.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities.<|endoftext|>
Others,Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I'm sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don't know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth. Find common ground, an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you.<|endoftext|>"
Information,We all have busy hectic lives at time. True friends make time to be with one another. This world is full of beautiful people to bond with. Keeping a closed circle of friends is a blessing.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hear how this is making you sad not feeling supported in the way that you need to be. Know that you are worthy and will find a way to connect with them. I hope this has helped.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear about your breakup. Was it your boyfriend that ended the relationship and how long were you guys together?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,this actually happened to me last year. my girlfriend ended things completely out of the blue. it came to light that she felt this way for a while but didn't know how to speak to me about it.<|endoftext|>
Information,it is true that relationships can have a big impact on us especially when the end suddenly and seemingly without reason. this must be very stressful.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,it does take time to get over a breakup especially one that ends suddenly but I think once you get over the initial shockyou seem like a positive person so I believe you can get over this.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about your feelings?<|endoftext|>
Information,speaking to others who have had similar experiences it's always a good idea. they may be able to offer a fresh perspective that you haven't considered before.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"that's good, I'd definitely reach out to her, especially when the Break-Up is so fresh. you may not be thinking clearly and a friend that.understands might really help.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,you have been through a really tough time. I do think you can get through this though and come out the other side. I believe you can do it!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can tell that you are worried that you will be lonely forever and I can tell you are anxious about that.<|endoftext|>
Others,"It is a big world out there and there will be someone else that is right for you. Personally, if he cheated then it may be a good thing that you found out now and not further down the line, after you had invested even more time into the relationship.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"I totally understand, I also identify myself as an Introvert. Never thought that in my lifespan I would want to go out and be around other people. what have you done so far to alleviate the lonely feelings?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Restatement or Paraphrasing","I have also done that as well, though I do miss the human to human connection. I have learn how to knit, hot make bread ( yes! bread lol), and got out of my comfort zone and watched different genres of movies along with books. I am a creature of habit with set routine, I really tried to get out of my bubble as much as I can. Keeping my mind busy makes the days go by faster. have you tried to do something new and challenging? how to make**.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"well I can tell you, the first 3 times I tried to make 'regular bread' it was a disaster. my bread came out hard as a rock. I kept working at it.

Self-disclosure,"Harry potter are THE books to dive into and just immerse yourself in. I would Highly recommend The Hobbit books, I was a bit hesitant about, but dare I say I like them more than Harry Potter? If you want something more adult and edgy go with Game of Thrones. I get it, I think this pandemic is a period to learn about ourselves and truly pick ourselves apart and see what we have missing out on.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Sounds to me you have been handling the pandemic a lot more better than what you actually think.

Question,What happened when you reached out to the teacher?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question,Information,Reflection of feelings","I think if you could teach yourself, the class wouldn't exist. Does your class have a study group? Usually schools offer free tutoring, because students volunteer to do it for credits toward a teaching degree. have you heard of that? There is always a way. You have to be smart to get a scholarship. You deserve to be in that class as much as anyone else.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Its always good to have someone to talk to, I am happy to help. I have felt stuck many times, so i can understand that.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Its hard to talk about certain problems, so I can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others. You might have just needed some space to evaluate your situation, nothing wrong with taking a break from things or people if it helps you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"From chatting with you I can tell you might be ready to start talking and maybe get some help or advice, family is a great start they are typically a great support system. It is okay to feel embarrassed but being unhappy will eat at you, sometimes its good to set our pride aside so that we can figure things out. In my situation of feeling stuck I was ashamed that I sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until I seen it as a problem that I started making my lists and getting advice. Some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help.

Reflection of feelings,Have you thought about if you can trust him after that?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I can understand where you are coming from.  I have been in that situation myself and it is not an easy place to be.  For me, it took some time to accept that I deserved better than someone who didn't just want me.  Is that how you feel?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Understandably so.  I believe that this is just temporary and you will be amazed at how strong you are.<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,You were put in a very difficult situation with multiple people. I can imagine that you have been so stressed out from the pressure of people hurting you.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I had this same problem in school and as I grew up I learned how to speak up and defend myself when people were rude and mean to me. I was my own advocate and you are also being your own by reaching out today and being so strong.<|endoftext|>
Others,I was told that I was overweight by others. I was able to defend myself by saying that I am a good person with a good heart and they are not important to me and neither are their opinions. I became more confident in myself. Have you ever wrote your feelings down in a journal?<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Have confidence in yourself as well! Chances are, others are struggling too.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Again, at the risk of being repetitive, it's all about the tone! I recently underwent group training. It was online since we are all working virtually.

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Thanks. Ok. The pandemic is particularly hard on extroverts. People look down on sex workers, but I think that the world is a big complex place and people are trying to make their way in it. If everyone is consenting, I see no problem. Have you tried psilocybin? Some people swear that it changes the inner monologue for the better. I am not a physician, but for long-term adjustment, it might be beneficial.<|endoftext|>"

Self-disclosure,I've had friends in the past who didn't call and I found out later that they were having personal struggles and it wasn't anything against me.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can see it being hard not knowing for sure.<|endoftext|>
Question,Sometimes people also grow and change so relationships evolve as well.  Is there something you would hope to gain from the friendship that you think could change?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I can see that being a challenge feeling guilty about whether you did something to affect the relationship.  But, you sound like you are really trying to make things work and maintain the friendship.<|endoftext|>"

We all go through similar situations in all of our lives. Its not about going through those situations it about for me what did  I learn and how will this make me better in the future.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Those situation sometimes shows us there was time in that friendship where we could have been over extending ourselves. Those are the times we should have been given more love and attention to our self.  We learn how to love ourselves more we others don't reciprocate what we give them.

Question,This is a serious matter. Have you spoken to anyone in the local government about this?<|endoftext|>
Information,You need to be strong for the sake of your children. How old are they?<|endoftext|>
Information,There should be a website for the local gov't in your city. Also: there are NGOs that help people in abusive relationships. They can provide counseling and more.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would contact a local hospital. They might have a list of NGOs that manage support groups.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"People want others to change, but usually that is too much to hope for. Important steps have to be taken by you first. The first step is to talk to someone and get perspective on your situation and learn what options you have.<|endoftext|>"
Others,My pleasure. I'm glad I was able to help you.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello. What's on your mind?<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,You're definite right to be questioning if this is the sort of person you want to be friends with.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"If her behavior is getting to you like this, I definitely suggest you try to keep some distance from her as much as you can.<|endoftext|>"

Question,What do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds like a good plan.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","What one person calls ghosting, someone else can call looking out for yourself. It sounds like she knows why you're upset with her and would be able to understand why you're choosing not to talk to her. If she's not interested in listening to you or thinking about what she's done, then you need to be doing what is best for you in cutting her out.<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,"It okay to cry, that the first step of letting all the negative emotions out. Trust me. Then you feel more free and the burden will be lifted. Then you will be better and more positive.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","Listen I'm on the same boat as you. It can get depressing. However, I light scented candles, play uplifting music on the background. I learn how to cook and started a new series on a netflix. I'll be honest, I'm a man (not like it means anything). I cry a couple times a week in the shower. Why? Because it helps get rid of the negatively that burdens me. After that I feel better.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Restatement or Paraphrasing","Remember it's okay to cry, then try breathing and then carry on with your day :). I'm glad to help!<|endoftext|>"

So it is safe to ay the chances of seeing each other is going to be impossible for a while. Would it be safe for you to try and chat with someone online that would care for you.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It may take a little time but watch your heart. it is very easy to break.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Surround yourself with family and friends. You might be surprised the person you meet wil be right there waiting.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance",Love is a funny Thing. U don't see the true love until you are in a spot of least accommodating.

Self-disclosure,"Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do.<|endoftext|>"

Others,Breakups can be really tough.  How long were you with your partner?<|endoftext|>

Question,What are your hours?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have to say, when I am physically and mentally exhausted, I don't think as clearly and lose hope more easily.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,9 to 11 would exhaust me. That is 14 hours?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you. Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That sounds reasonable to me. And if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. Tell them, I'm sorry, but I feel this is reasonable, and truly it is.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",No one can work 24/7.  I think they may not even be aware you are struggling. So communication is important. You don't want to crack. It's not worth it.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I will say a prayer that you communicate your needs politely but firmly. And not believe false guilt. As you said, you aren't putting out fires and doing CPR.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions","This has been a stressful year for many of us, you don't need to be working yourself into depression and exhaustion. You really do not NEED a reason not to work unreasonable hours.<|endoftext|>"
Others,It isn't anyone's business what you do on your off hours.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I do suggest you simply stick to the facts. These are the hours, I can't work more.  You don't need to explain that to anyone. But be firm and polite. And you are very welcome. Sometimes we just need a friend! :D.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I've been in that boat before. It isn't easy, but I learned what I had to do, and I don't get in that boat anymore. And I can see to help others get out.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Amen!  GREAT!  I'm glad to hear it!<|endoftext|>

Question,What's on your mind today?<|endoftext|>
Question,How long have you been in this state?<|endoftext|>
Others,Is there any event happened the last few days that triggered your depression?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","That is tough, having depression and dealing with children at the same time. I totally understand how you feel. I think you should first talk to your partner about your situation and ask for help from them.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That's great, you have an awesome partner. I'd recommend spending time outdoor. Getting coop up for too long indoor is damaging to your mental state.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you considered hiring caretaker?<|endoftext|>
Others,"whenever possible, you can take your children out with you on a trip to the park or the mountain. Nature is also good for kids with special need.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","You are such a great mom, I can totally see how much you sacrificed for them. But please take care of yourself, i think you should see a therapist and get proper treatment. If you do not do well, how can you care for you family?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Exercising might be helpful too. I like doing yoga or pilates, it really eases my mind when I have too much going on.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I believe you will overcome this!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi! I am sorry to heard that. I would be very glad to help if you could please tell me what bothers you.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can see why you are concerned. These are certainly difficult times and this pandemic doesn't seem to be stopping anytime now. I understand your frustation.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Many apps offer videocalls that you can use to chat with your loved ones though. Zoom is a great one, fore example!<|endoftext|>"
Information,"It surely does. You can always travel, just make sure that you are maintaining social distancing and your mask at all times. If you and your family members follow the protocols, it is very unlikely that any of you is exposed to the virus.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","I understand. It's especially risky when kids are involved. Hey, you need to remind yourself that things will not be this way forever. A vaccine will be developed soon, and things will be just like they used to!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"When the pandemic first started, I felt like I was frozen in my life. Nothing was happening and any signs of progress had stopped. I can definetely relate. However, I found that exploring new hobbies and focusing on improving as a person were great ways to take good use of time.<|endoftext|>"
Information,That's great! I heard that some people are even deciding to grow their own food as much as possible. That greatly helps the environment and avoids pollution and global warming. Are you planning on applying that as part of your gardenning hobby?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It's great that you are doing an activity that you enjoy. I can just imagine how beautiful of a scenery that creates.<|endoftext|>
Others,Teaching your kids is a great idea! Not many kids nowadays enjoy a lot of outdoor activities. Being in connection with nature is important to maintain a balance and increase our happinness overall.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Haha that does sound like fun. Just watch out for any insects on those fruits or any impurities!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello! what seems to be bothering you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I'm thinking your upset because you can't leave so you're stuck. Is that correct?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",It's completely normal to feel that way. I'm sure you're handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I would feel the same way if that's a house I grew up in. I'm so sorry!<|endoftext|>
"Information,Question","If he's in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that. Do you have people to talk to about this? It sounds like a lot to handle.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","I think it would be good for you to talk to someone and get help. Right now, all you can do is keep chugging along and trying your best to stay afloat.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Information",I would suggest talking to a therapist if your insurance can handle that! Talking with them can help you figure out what you should do.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes it is. Especially now. I just want to encourage to keep pushing. Think about yourself in a year or two from now. Do everything you can right now to get out of the situation. If it gets really bad, don't be afraid to call out for help (like the police). Stay safe and do what's best for you. You've got this!<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,oh wow that's terrible. that must be so stressful for you.<|endoftext|>
Others,yes of course! I hope everything works out in the end. You'll be in my thoughts :).<|endoftext|>
Others,Please remember to end the conversation.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Hi. How can I help?<|endoftext|>
Information,"What has happened? I know that sometimes life can get tough and just know that you are not alone. Sometimes the toughest parts of life, make us so much stronger.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Why do you think it's your body? I am sure that your body is just fine! Have you thought about taking up a hobby or activity to get your mind off of it?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I understand. What kinds of things do you enjoy? I have found that exercise is great for mental health and such a good way to take your mind off of things. Have you ever felt interested in any psychical activities?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Do you have any friends or family to help you? I know exactly what you mean. Starting a new activity can be so hard when you aren't familiar. One thing that you might find helpful is to join in a group class at the gym. Do you think you'd like that?<|endoftext|>
Others,That's great! Do you know what kind of class would be of interest? I think that you have the tools to be who you want to be. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and I think you'll be just fine! You may even find a life long passion or friendship! You never know what is around the corner.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Those both sounds great! Yoga is great for the body and the mind! I will sometimes just do it to clear my mind after a tough day. If your nervous about it, you could try out a few online classes first to see what to expect.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's understandable. Everyone has insecurities in unfamiliar places but in reality, most people are too wrapped up in their own heads they don't even notice anything else. You just have to feel confident and not worry about what other people think, that will set you free.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question",I have suffered from depression and know how hard that can be. What seems to have brought it on?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Oh that is hard being separated from family.  Are you unable to t5ravel right now?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",I see. So are you being followed by a specialist?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Okay so you are not feeling well enough to travel and see your kids am I right?<|endoftext|>
Question,"That sounds like it would be isolating...are you able to keep in touch with people by telephone, video chat and what not, are you feeling well enough for that?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I know when I am depressed I don't want to see or talk to anyone...<|endoftext|>
Question,"Oh I'm so glad you are in touch in that way, do you find them supportive?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is there any way they can come and visit you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed right now.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Is there anyone else besides your specialist and your kids that you can reach out to for support in your community, even if it's just by pone?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"And you won't feel this way forever, it will pass, know that, even if it does not feel like it, it will.  It can be hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel when we are depressed.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Oh that's great you have a supportive wife!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"In my community we have mental health programs, I am actually doing some via zoom, do you know if there is anything like that you can access?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I understand that shut down feeling....I close right up when I am down.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Feeling worthless, uninterested in going out, those are symptoms of depression, they will pass.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Lack of interest in things is also a symptom of depression.   Once your depression lifts it will come back.   I'll tell you what helped me when I was depresed...<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I was taught to make very small goals.  For example, I found it hard to go out for a walk, even though I knew it would help my depression. (Exercise has been shown to be as effective as antidpressants)  So I was told, just walk around the block.  If that's too much, walk to the corner.   If that's too much, walk to the end f the driveway.  If that's too much, step outside.   If that's too much, put your shoes on.   Baby steps. And whatever small step you manage to acheive, celebrate it and reward yourself.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","Ultimately, my last depression it was getting my covid shot that helped most....lifted a bunch of fear and anxiety and restored my hope. Does your specialist know you are this down?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"And losing your mum last Easter, you are probably still dealing with grief on top of everything else.   My parents are gone too, grief can be a long process.  Grief is tough.  That will get easier with time.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"The thing is though, depression is an illness.   Would you take meds for another sort of illness, something physical?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","That is hard, I'm sorry you are hurting. Have you tried writing down your thoughts and feelings in a journal?<|endoftext|>"
Question,okay so the PTSD is related to time in the military?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Are there any veterans groups in your area that help with that? Maybe connecting with others ""in the same boat"" would help.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Or maybe there is a way online you could do that, virtual meetings, since you find it hard to get out.   Could you handle a zoom group meeting?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I attend zoom group meetings for my mental health.  They have helped.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You are going through a lot, but you are stronger than you feel, I know you can get through this.   Things will get easier.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you done any research online about PTSD....perhaps your veteran organization has resources on their website.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"That is so hard, I hear you.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Research is something solitary you can do.<|endoftext|>
Question,Whereabouts do you live?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well you are being honest.  Some people will be able to handle that, some won't, but either way it takes courage to communicate how badly you feel.<|endoftext|>"
Information,ok good.   I see online that Tennessee Dept of Veterans lists some mental health resources.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You will have fun again.   Your feelings are due to depression, you will get through it, it will lift.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Good.   Be honest and open with your specialist please?  That's important.   It's a pleasure listening to you, you're welcome.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Aw thank you for the compliment.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","Honestly, I have been ill with depression several times, and have felt hopeless...and it always lifted. You're so welcome.   Feel better soon.<|endoftext|>"
Others,And don't give up!!!<|endoftext|>
Others,"You have your wife and kids you are not alone :)  Bye take care, things will get better. If you hit the quit button it will end the session :).<|endoftext|>"
Question,Oh I see.  What's happening with your son?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",Oh that's hard to deal with.   My daughter ran with a bad crowd for a while and I remember the deep worry. What sort of behaviour are you noticing?  How old is he?<|endoftext|>
Question,And when you try and talk to him about it what does he say?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Reflection of feelings","Oh I see.  Apart from isolating how is he doing otherwise, like at school?  Is he still seeing his friends at all? It can be scary not knowing what our kids are up to online.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Hmm.  So a lot of mystery.   I can understand you being worried.   Is he your only child?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information","Thats good parenting!   Perhaps if you frame it as being about you, e.g. ""I am getting really worried, can you please explain....it's affecting me (affecting my sleep/work/whatever"" .... maybe it will inspire him to be more forthcoming. Any signs of depression?   I have been depresed before, and self-isolating can be a symptom, I've been there...<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","Hmm.  My other thought is tell him what you just told me, that you have been trying to show him that you trust him....but be honest and tell him you are afraid.   Hopefully, he won't want you feeling that way, and will open up a bit. Yes I can see that being concerning when you know nothing about the friend.   Yet you walk a fine line because he needs the freedom and autonomy to choose his friends without explanation required...it's such a balancing act.   I can tell you that I have raised a daughter, and that teen years were tougher than toddlerhood.   Lots of worry, but she came through it and is fine now. I wonder if there is a teacher he is close to that you could bring your concerns to, perhaps the teacher may have some insight about yoru son to offer?<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Self-disclosure","Oh good.   And it may be just a normal part of his development.   Teens pull away from parents, peer group becomes far more important.  It may be as simple as that. It took my daughter about 15 years to ""come back to me"" and now we have a close relationship again....so even if he seems to be drifting away know that it's normal and that will change in the future.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"And in the meantime remember to take extra good care of yourself :)   Sometimes as moms we forget to do special things for ourselves.   You are doing the hardest and most imporant job in the world so it's important to recognize that and reward yourself for it.   I hope that conversation goes well for you, that you will have with him.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Oh you're so welcome, it's been a pleasure speaking with you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,bye :).<|endoftext|>
Question,I am okay thanks. Do you have anything specific that you'd like to talk to me about?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I see .. so you feel that you will not be able to pass this program at the current time?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",Is there any possibility of postponing this till a later date? For one  thing the world situation is very insecure at the moment and you have the right to say that you just feel that you want to self isolate right now. Are you a member of any sort of union that might be able to liase on your behalf? There are plenty of organisations out there.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Okay, well, firstly I think it's a good idea to try to stay calm and not let yourself be overwhelmed. Is it possible to get any sort of tuition to prepare for the exam?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I am very sorry. I remember very well the stress of exams and the horrible feeling that you might fail.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can tell how insecure you are feeling about this. Does it help to let you know that you are not alone?<|endoftext|>
Question,Are they normally understanding of things like this? Do you have a good boss?<|endoftext|>
Others,It sounds like they are pretty reasonable. I really hope that it goes well for you. Thanks for talking and all the best.<|endoftext|>
Others,I am really glad to hear it. All the best to you.<|endoftext|>
Others,Please remember to take the survey :).<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello my name is Sue, how are you today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Why are you sleepy?  Long day?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh I see, so you aren't getting enough sleep am I right?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What typically happens when you try to go to sleep?   Is it hard to quiet your mind?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Not sleeping well is a problem I have on and off as well, and I have found those next days so tiring and frustrating.   If you like I can share some of the things that have helped me?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Information,Providing Suggestions","I use this great free podcast called Tracks to Relax, it has guided meditations that really help me get to sleep.  The seem to shut down my mind when I am thinking too much at bedtime.   Which can happen to me some nights, anxieties can keep me awake. The host's voice is super soothing and he spirits you away to the beach or the woods and before you know it you're out! I also have strict bedtime/waketime that I follow, it's set up on my cellphone.  No more sleepign in, because that just made it harder for me to get to sleep the next night.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Question",um I think there may be a website but I found it by opening up the Podcast app on my phone and doing a search..  There are premium options but I just use the free stuff. do you use spotify?<|endoftext|>
Others,"um i am not sure let me check real quickly, one moment.<|endoftext|>"
Others,yes it is!  you are welcome.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions","The reason I brought up spotify is that sometimes I listen to a playlist on there called ""Gentle Lapping Waves"" which is super relaxing...and I set my cellphone to turn it off after half an hour or so.   As for Tracks to Relax I think most are about 40 minutes?   To be honest I am not sure.   I fall asleep midway through hehe. do you have someone you can talk to about your anxieties like a counsellor?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"OH another trick I use to get the thoughts ""out of my head"" is journaling.  You are so welcome, it's been a pleasure talking with you.   All the best in your quest for a good night's sleep :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,you as well :).<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions,Question","I am so sorry to hear that. I know how that feels. That is horrible he said hurtful things, but perhaps he didn't know how to manage what he was feeling. Was it a mutual breakup or did something happen?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance,Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Realizing someone isn't the same you fell in love with seems valid. Fighting over a salad is definately not something most couples argue over. He probably did feel attacked, but I am sure he noticed the continual fighting as well. It sounds like you did what was best for you. We all deserve to be happy, and it sounds like you really were not anymore. Are you having any regrets on the breakup?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I think I have said the same thing in a breakup so I wouldn't take that personal.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others,Providing Suggestions","People say things they dont mean, or just say mean things to hurt because they are hurting. lol exactly. I bet there is someone out there for you, you jut need to find someone whos ideas of the future line up with yours.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps if you set up a dating profile have that be an intro question: is a salad a meal? you can weed people out that way!!!!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It sounds like you are going to be okay, and I am sure you will find someone when the time is right!<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","I agree, and I wish you the bet of luck! You are welcome!<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I will try my best. I specialise in yoga and meditation.<|endoftext|>
Question,How long has this been happening for?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing","This may be an obvious question, but can you think of something that has changed in the last two weeks? Think about work related, personal life, changes in behaviour?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question","It might solve as a temporary solution, however, if whatever happened at work to cause this continues when you return from holidays, you will just have the same problem again. What exactly do you think is causing it? Additional work/responsibilities? New manager?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried to speak to your manager about these additional responsibilities? Do you know if it is a short term problem or you will always have extra work being assigned?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions,Information,Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","I don't think I can share links over here, however the activities you perform directly before you go to sleep have a direct impact on your sleeping. I would recommend trying to practice 30m-1h of yoga (you can find lodes of exercise videos on the internet to follow), followed by a mediation sound track for you to listen to in bed while you try to sleep. Keep your body and mind clear before you go to sleep has proven to allow for a better sleep. I used to have sleeping issues, and I started doing this 2 years ago, and I completely changed. I am an investment banker and still am, it is a very stressful environment however this has allowed me to work at the very top and remain in control of my body and mind. Please try this for 1 week, I know you can do it and I know it will help you long term.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thanks so good, I have really enjoyed talking to you too.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"My pleasure, you too.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Bye.<|endoftext|>
Others,hello how are you.<|endoftext|>
Question,"im good, what is not going well?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"ok lets talk about this, so you are feeling depressed because you cannot find a job due to covid.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"im sorry that you feel this way, covid is really making it difficult to find work. I also have not been able to get a job due to covid.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,are there any resources avaible to you such as unemployment or other local agencies that might be able to help you pay your bills?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,that sounds really difficult.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,do you have any family that could possibly help you through this time.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,maybe contact them after we are done talking and tell them what is going on.<|endoftext|>
Others,is there anything else that you would like to talk about or ways I can help you?<|endoftext|>
Others,OF COURSE! I wish you the best.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi there, how are you today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can you tell me what's going on to cause you to feel this way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I see. I definitely understand how long bouts of depression can make you feel more hopeless. Have you discussed your depression with anyone else before?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Yeah, it sounds like you aren't suicidal. Though I do have to check; have you had any thoughts or tendencies of suicide or self-harm?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I understand. Can you provide any more information about your meeting with the therapist? You said talking to one didn't help, do you know why?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",That makes sense and is completely natural. It's difficult sometimes to open up to a stranger that you don't completely know or might not trust. It definitely sounds frustrating that she seemed like she was reading from a script. And I'm glad to hear you think I'm doing alright lol.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That's interesting. I know from experience that finding a good therapist is all about trial and error, unfortunately. It's important to find the right fit and I would definitely suggest looking for a new one. Do you know of anyone in your life, maybe a friend or family member, that has been to therapy that you would be comfortable getting a recommendation from?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"That sounds like a great idea! Remember to keep your friends close too. I know it can be tough when you feel as low as this, but it's important to have a good support system in addition to any therapy you might be receiving.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's great to hear! It really sounds like you can go to them for support and often being there for someone else can make us feel better too.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Aww that's so good of you to say!! I do want to confirm that you have a game-plan now, though. Remember to keep your friends close and to start looking for a new therapist if you haven't already. If you find one that's not the right fit it doesn't hurt to start over or maybe even ask for a recommendation from that therapist. If they're any good they should understand how important it is for you to find a good fit. Also remember to be kind to yourself. It can be difficult, but I know you can do it.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That's absolutely wonderful to hear! Is there anything else you would like to discuss today?<|endoftext|>
Others,Awesome. You've got this! Have a good rest of your day.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I'm very sorry to hear you're going through that.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help.  I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Sure, that's understandable.  There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Now that is intractable.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety.  Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Not in a scary, better-off-dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion.  I'm a flea to the universe.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"God, tell me more, lol.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Galaxies gonna spiral.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","Yeah they have kicked the can down to local governments, local governments kick the can down to the citizens.  It's absurd. No on wants to take responsibility for taking responsibility. It's a very uncertain situation and it's a psychological reality that when we don't have physical or metnal security, it's extremely hard for a human being to progress through stages in life or learn new skill as well or at all.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"So everyone's plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit's going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Of course, have a great evening!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hello how are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am very sorry to hear that. Breakups can be rough. I'm great! Thanks for asking. Was this a mutual agreement?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Was there a reasoning behind your decision? Sometimes we let our anger and emotions make our decisions for us.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Absolutely! You have an amazing day and keep you head up!<|endoftext|>
Question,would you like to talk about it?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Just By chatting with you, I can feel how hurt and upset you are . Is there anyone that can provide you support at home during this time?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"This is a very challenging time for you especially when there is lack of support. I do feel your pain, And I would like to share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through. Would you e open to hear them out?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight. Do you think that, you can try something like this?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I am so proud of you for giving this a try. I would like to suggest OCB relaxing music , which will help you relax.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I am so glad that you are feeling better. Just rest assured that I will be here for you should you need to talk to some one and I will do my best to support and guide you.<|endoftext|>
Others,Have a great day.<|endoftext|>
Others,thank you.<|endoftext|>
Question,your school doesn't offer remote learning?<|endoftext|>
Others,you can still do that online instead of in person.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I understand how you may feel that way, it's easy to feel anxious when something you do so frequently  gets taken away.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Your worry is very understandable, have you talked to your professors about that to see what they can help?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"that sounds great. I find that your mindset is very important, you can only finish great if you feel at ease. Why don't you just wait and study on your own first, and officially start when you feel reassured?<|endoftext|>"
Others,How about create an online study group with your friends if you need to get a degree in time. Either Zoom or Skype is user friendly.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Oh no, you don't even have to install Zoom. I have been in a lot of Zoom conference where I simply access through the link they give me.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"yeah, so don't be too pessimistic. There are always solutions. Other than group study, are there any reasons you worry about school?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"if you prefer to be able to discuss in person, how about do an in person meeting at the park or open space? That way you can keep your distance.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"No problems, I'm glad I could be some help.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Restatement or Paraphrasing","Hey there, please do share! I would love to help! Why is your job causing you to have anxiety?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I see, so you have difficulty dealing with a co-worker. Let ask, Is there anyway of talking to her about her behavior? Also does she behave this way with others?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question",What I do recommend is contacting a mediator or someone from HR and having a sit down. Since clearly this is affecting you at work and outside of it. Talking to HR should help. What do you think?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Honestly don't let it stress you out, don't bring issues at work back home. I also recommend finding ways to destress, listening to music, lightning candles or starting a series on netflix.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Glad to help!<|endoftext|>
Others,"No problem, I hope enjoy the rest of your day!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Personally, I spend time with family. Then I have a can of seltzer, watch something on netflix and unwind.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Haha it's a winning combination. Maybe a salty snack or something sweet depending how stressful the day was.<|endoftext|>
Question,Good evening . How can I help you.<|endoftext|>
Question,So you are having issues with your friend? That is upsetting . What is the issue?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can understand how angry unappreciated and burnt out you must be feeling.  I would feel that way too.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I don't think she is a place to be able to see anyone but herself. She is self centereed self asbored and self pity party and doesn't care about anyone but herself right now . Is that accurate?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I completely understand how unappreciated and stressed this would make you or any person. Especially when our plate is full and its the same old same old and nothing is changing. Its like thinking doing same thing over and over you will get a different result when 2+2 equals 4.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You are an extremely good and loyal friend and I am so proud of you. Most people would have left her.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"However, it is time to take the hard road. YOu are going to have to say with LOVE because its not always what you say but how you say it.  Give me a minute to please type it.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You are going to have to sit her down and say  I need to be honest with you.  I have always been there for you but you are not willing to take my advice or others advice and quite frankly I just can't do it anymore. IF you want to remain friends I need you to grow up and realize the world doesn't revolve around you or even me.  Right now I could really use a good friend. I am going thru A LOT OF Sh** and I don't need this in my life. So.<|endoftext|>
Others,if you aren't able to do that than I am afraid until you can be a true friend and not just a user than I need to end this friendship . I don't want to but I need to for my mental health and for myself and even for you.  I say this because I love you and I do care but this has become toxic.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,she really needs to hear it and it sounds toxic to me . I know I wouldn't want a friend to accuse me of not being there and from the chat look like its all about her and she s acting like a spoiled brat.<|endoftext|>
Information,If you think its a more serious problem maybe ask her to seek professional help.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,youre welcome and above all continue to pray for her or start praying for her. You really are a great loyal intelligent person. Keep safe.<|endoftext|>

Question,Do you not know anyone else there?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Do you think it would benefit you to join some groups or societies where you would meet new people? If you feel a little out of your depth, that is perfectly normal at this stage!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Yes of course. So you feel that you cannot meet new people due to the pandemic?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand that this is a bad time to be making a new start but please believe me, I think that things will get better.<|endoftext|>"
Information,It sounds to me like you might be suffering from depression. A lot of the population have this problem! Do you think that this might be the case?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That definitely sounds like depression to me. Can I suggest that you talk to your doctor?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,So you have insight into your condition at least ...  that is a very positive thing!<|endoftext|>
Question,What is it that you feel that you should be doing? Please do not put too much pressure on yourself!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I understand how that feels. I often feel the same way myself, especially now (and at this time of year). Please do not feel bad about it.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I have sometimes felt this way too. Do you have a pet? I have two cats and they do help to cheer me up when I feel especially bad.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Others",So you feel that you are bad at life? Please do not! I do need to go now but I hope that you can find some comfort in the future. I wish you all the best.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others",I am so sorry to hear that. I lost one of my cats earlier this year. I will and thank you for talking too.<|endoftext|>
Others,(I really did lose a cat earlier this year btw :( ).<|endoftext|>
Others,Thank you for talking and all the best.<|endoftext|>
Others,I always do :) You kind of have to press quit and take a survey to exit.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hey. How can I help?<|endoftext|>
Question,Okay. Well lets start with exactly what the problem is. What kind of tips do you need?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Okay I understand. Tell me a little about that.<|endoftext|>
Question,That is unfortunate. How did you accumulate such debt?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,That's tough. It has personally affect me as well as my financial health as well. I know the frustration.<|endoftext|>
Question,Well to do so I need a little more information. Have you already taken any steps to help your situation? If so what steps have you taken?<|endoftext|>
Others,Okay that is an excellent start. Now to avoid another debt later on. Do you have a job to work with the payments to pay back the loan?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,If I may offer a suggestion. Have you thought of contacting a debt relief program? In some cases they can substantially reduce debt to something much more manageable.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","I'm sorry you're feeling blue. I can understand, the job market is really tough right now. You're not alone in feeling this way, but that doesn't change how hard it can be.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yeah, sometimes job postings feel fake. In the past, I've found various jobs online. Sometimes it takes a while but if you keeping putting out applications, something good will come your way eventually.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you're worried about your skillset. Is there any way you can improve or learn new things?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You seem like a bright, open minded person. I think you could learn a lot in a new role. There are many online retailers that could be a great opportunity.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"There are still many brick and mortar stores that will open after the pandemic is over, hopefully that will bring opportunity.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Are you interested in taking any classes to improve your skillset? There are many free courses available online.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Thank you, I enjoy talking with people and helping them in any way I can. Wow, learning french must be fun. If you can learn another language, I have faith you can learn new skills for a job. That's really great, good for you!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Learning new languages can open up new opportunities for work. It is unique to be bilingual. Make sure to put all your unique attributes, such as learning french, on your resume. It might help!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are there any other fields of work you are interested in working besides retail?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would recommend calling the company or searching for a contact via LinkedIn or just google and trying to make a connection there. LinkedIn has helped me many times in the past when I'm applying for jobs.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure","Earning a license for loans or for real estate sounds like a great way to add to your skillset. No, I do not have the premium package.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Typically I will search for a company and then look at the employees based on that search. If I see anyone who I have a common connection with or just something similar, I reach out.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","There is also a site called UpWork. I do not have personal experience with it but have heard it's a good way to make a bit of money while unemployed. They have small jobs for people to complete. Yes that may be the case. Hopefully as the vaccine becomes more widespread, the job market will improve.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you, it was very nice chatting with you as well. Stay hopeful, I believe you will find an opportunity. Happy Holidays!<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,You're welcome. I hope you are feeling less blue and less anxious about the job market.<|endoftext|>
Question,Im doing good. How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Would you be willing to talk about it with me? Sometimes talking with someone is the help that we need.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I can sense how stressed you are about the safety of your job. This pandemic has caused so much stress and very much anxiety on everyone, so just know you are not alone. I'm not sure on the work you do, but you putting your health at risk everyday to make a living for you and your family makes you an amazing person. Just try and remember that your health is very much more important then your job and just make sure you are trying everything possible to keep yourself safe out there.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Of course! I also am afraid that this pandemic is going to get worse before it gets any better and that is just my opinion. I am scared for everyone out here anymore and its not just people getting sick and ill, but people like you who could be in jeopardy of loosing their job or their source of income. That's is something that would be on anyones mind, more yours then mine due to you actually working in the public.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"We thankfully have not got on lockdown just yet, but I know it will be happening soon. We live in a very small town and it has got bad here that either we know someone who has it, or someone in the family has it. It seemed like it just happened over night that it just spread so fast here that everyone is in a panic mode again. What type of things do you do while you are on lockdown?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I can only imagine. Is it yourself in your home? What I have tried to do is stay away from the news that has anything to do with covid that could maybe help a little. And god forbid anything happens to you and you do loose your job just know there are a lot of resources around that would help you in any struggles that you fear or end up facing. I know its hard and stressful to search and look for things like that but trust me it will take a lot of stress off your mind.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sorry about that I didn't realize I put that, sometimes it just comes out but I do apologize. I know it's hard to think that this will not come to and end, but just try and think there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm hoping for you and what your doing and putting in, something will come out positive in your favor, even if its just a small step forward. Hey its all gotta start out somewhere.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you have children or a spouse that lives with you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I have children as well, and what I have tried to do is like a at home drive in movie night, or simple board games. I don't have a spouse but I would think maybe an inside dinner night or even a lunch date. Have the kids even help out with that. You'll be amazed on how excited they would be even if it's the little things they can help with like the seating or drawing of the menus. And for maybe the inside drive in make up little movie tickets, and candy and popcorn like a little concession stand.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I completely understand. I know its hard not to think about it because it is EVERYWHERE, but if your spouse or children see or sense the stress its causing you they can also feel it, and can start stressing over it too. Even trying these things will cause a smile and a fun time for those moments that will make every one happy and not think about covid, because they will all be thinking about how much fun they are having with you and the family, and that will help with the stress even if its just a little bit.<|endoftext|>"
Question,How are you doing?<|endoftext|>
Question,Anything you need to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's very common is there anything that has change that doesn't allow you to sleep?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yes that has been a big stressor for many. I sometimes find myself having trobule to fall asleep. So I make sure my room is dark and think about something relaxing.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","no tv, cell phones etc. a hot shower before bed might help. When you can not shut your mind down it will prevent you from thinking and so I will actually to clear my head just think of something relaxing or enjoyable.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Try to make sure the room is dark and for whatever reason they say a glass of warm milk too but I never had to try that, just relaxing thoughts and a dark room and a fan idk.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,the sound of the fan can be relaxing for me idk why.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,sometimes white noise helps or the sounds of frogs on an app idk why but that works for some people too. The important thing is find something that works and relaxes your mind from thinking too much if you can.<|endoftext|>
Information,a running river or something that is tranquil to you and frogs work for some people or crickets idk why lol.<|endoftext|>
Information,Hopefully this pandemic willl be over and we can all go back to work.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question","It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","Ah....relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can imagine how a break in trust has made you feel. I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process.<|endoftext|>
Question,Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you feel that her actions and result can be remedied? Or is this such a fundamental break that you cannot reconcile?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Understandable. I would feel similar, in truth.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",Only you know whether or not if you can look to forgiving and moving forward or if this is such a fundamental break that it is not something you can mend. And if you know that this is not something you wish to move forward with her that doesn’t make you a bad person. It means you are taking care of yourself first.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Absolutely. Trust is to me a cornerstone of healthy relationships. So I can fully appreciate those feelings and needs. I think fundamentally as humans we want to partner with individuals who we find that we can feel safe with and trust.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I do think, and I am not sure how old you are, but infidelity is unfortunately not super rare. I have experienced it myself. I used some resources on even places like Reddit (Surviving Infidelity) to help me process what I had experienced and to also learn from others.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",I also talked to a few friends who are married and had experienced infidelity. They chose to forgive each other. I learned a lot from them. It helped me to make up my own mind as to how I needed to move forward. I didn’t want to use a therapist since I do better with discussing ideas with multiple people. But ultimately you may experience a lot of ups and downs. That is also normal. It is your mind and heart processing everything. Please do not get discouraged.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I understand that, it is hard to find a job. I got terminated during the beginning of covid.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. Not the best situation but hey, my family can eat.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions","Thats good at least. Well, its great you are being proactive about it! I hate saying this but, just hang in there and keep moving on.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I hear ya, im doing everything i can to make a bit of extra money just so my kid can have a semi normal christmas!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yea i feel so bad for her. Thing is so presents arent everythign. Since you got little ones might be time for some new traditions. Make some ""igloo"" forts and have an indoor snowball fight with balled of socks or something like that.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thanks for sharing!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Hmm lets see, more a fun thing to do then advice, my daughter saw some xmas dessert she wants to make. Its pretty simple. Get some candy canes and poke em into marshmellows. Melt some chocolate and dip the marshmellows into them. Cover with sprinkles and let harden. Might be a fun thing to do. Id focus on experience over material this holiday.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yea, i hope things work out for you!<|endoftext|>"
Others,You as well!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Good how are you doing?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it?<|endoftext|>"
Information,I would be willing to do that.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Break ups are the worst and feeling blue is totally understandable.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection is important but healing and moving on which will take a little time is also important :-).<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yes distraction is really good like taking up a new interest or reading a good book something like that. Any friends you can hang out with?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yes this pandemic has really been hard on social interaction and a good book you can be great distraction.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I am a Yogi Bear too and that is great for relaxation we did the angry dog and we barked lol in class yesterday. We meet outside in the park even finding a remote space in a park might do some good you never know.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Perfect :-).<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,About 10 years. I need it and it really does help ease the stress for me.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",I have been in that same situation before! I had the exact feelings you are! But after realizing how much I studied it helped me relax. Have you talked to your teachers about your worrying?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Self-disclosure","From what I have seen, people who have noticed they are having issues tend to come out ahead! Its great that you are thinking about how to get through this. I also get into slumps with being productive and motivation, I was told when that happens that I just need to take a step back and relax for a little bit.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's really great! I bet you are closer than you think to finishing those deadlines.<|endoftext|>
Question,"When you are usually in a last minute crunch, what do you do to get past it?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I know some people look for tutors, or others taking the same classes for inputs on work that has to be turned in. Is there an easy way for you to put the other preoccupations to the side so they are not so distracting?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Thats good! I bet that would help out a lot, that tends to be the case for me!<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Thats good, research has shown that moving our distractions to the side allows us to focus more on the task at hand!<|endoftext|>"
Others,I am glad to hear that! I bet you can get those deadlines finished no problem.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I am glad I was able to help, You got this, I bet you don't have this issue again.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Well thank you! Let me know if you need help with anything else!<|endoftext|>
Others,You as well!<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure",I can definetely understand why. During this pandemic we have been more isolated than ever. It's not easy.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"It is more than reasonable to be frustrated with regards to that. I myself have not been able to visit my ill mother. She lives in another country, so it's especially difficult.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Exactly, the experience feels like it lacks the main connection we share with our loved ones. It is totally normal to want to be face to face instead.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information","I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling. However, it's not the end of the world. Thankfully, researchers have just came up with a vaccine prototype I heard.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I know it's not easy, but try to think of this whole situation of a challenge that you are overcoming. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. You will come out of this ready for any hardships that life might throw at you.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","It will hopefully be over sooner than we think. Just try to keep a positive attitude, focus on the things you like, and time will fly. I know it can be hard, but I am sure you got this.<|endoftext|>"

Others,You too!<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am fine as well, thanks for asking. How may i support you today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I understand. May I please know what is the cause of your depression?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Yes. The world is in a pretty bad place due to the pandemic. It has caused infinite sufferings to numerous people.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"We are all in this together. With proper emotional support, each of us can overcome these turbulent times.<|endoftext|>"
Information,It may seem pretty bad now with the cold weather setting in at many parts of the world. But there is a vaccine coming soon.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Think about the positive aspects of an effective vaccine. Do not stress too much about factors outside your control. I know we can feel helpless at some times, but try to focus on things under YOUR control - like following health professional advise - masks, social distancing and general sanitization.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information,Question","I agree. Family is our only an true source of strength. Being away from them can be really hard. But atleast, thanks to technology, they are only a video/phone call away. Regarding your job, I know a lot of jobs and industries have been affected. But at the same time, it has exploded demand in personal delivery services. If you are able to drive, would you be willing to explore the option of part time grocery/food delivery driver?<|endoftext|>"
Others,Oh that's good to hear! I apologize for the assumption earlier.<|endoftext|>
Others,I appreciate your feedback! Just hang in there and we shall overcome this :).<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Yes, a lot of times! You are not alone in this.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm glad to hear you're doing well in these trying times.<|endoftext|>
Question,How have you been managing everything?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Same here, it's a tough time to do that after doing it so long. Especially with the holidays coming up.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are you in close proximity to your family?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I imagine that can create some stress?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well I'm glad to hear it, sounds like you've been managing pretty well then.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I assume that means you're in college then? So the stress of finals is over now?<|endoftext|>
Others,"That's good, I hope they went well for you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, now you can relax and spend time with your family without the added stress.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Well I hope you and your family enjoy the holidays and stay safe.<|endoftext|>
Others,Thanks so much!<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes, just my immediate family.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Absolutely, the best thing we can do right now. Even though it's kind of a bummer.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I hope so too, this has been such a crazy year.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Good evening, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What can I help you out with tonight?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds like a complicated situation.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is the project something you will become responsible for?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Is that a responsibility you want to have, or is it a burden that is being thrust upon you?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, I think if it's truly a responsibility you want, you will work to live up to it as best you can.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's excellent, not many people can say that!  It's starting to sound more and more like an opportunity for you to prove yourself :-).<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","That's an unfortunate part of most group projects, I hate to say.  Interpersonal communication can be so hard.  I have been a project manager in the past, and found that you have to consider Person XYZ did not wake up in the morning and decide to make your life harder. And as long as you can keep things polite and professional, everyone gets to go home separately, thankfully!  Haha.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Foster the people around you that can provide you support, be a reliable producer and leader, and you will find that those that don't like you will move on.  And, most importantly, you can only control how you respond/behave.  If someone wants to instigate conflict, that will reflect poorly upon them.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You can only engage with what abuse and hostility you accept.  If you smile in response, it will make you feel better than if you internalize their aggression.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hello!<|endoftext|>
Others,I'm fine. How are you? Is there any issue I can help you with?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's a really tough thing to deal with. It can be hard to be confronted with a different, unexpected side from a trusted friend.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Perhaps you can try reasoning with him. I'm certain that your judgement in friendships is not flawed and although he has made quite the yikes choice, he still has redeemable qualities. Especially if he wasn't making his political viewpoint known until recently. It leans towards the idea that with the right information, he'll understand that Trump is a big loser and he lost lmao.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Consider directing him to news sources that are not Twitter or Facebook, though I know this is hard to do. it is just a teensy bit funny he thinks that Trump is being muzzled on twitter when they are not deleting any of his tweets.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"This seems like a very sudden reaction from him, from what I've gathered, seeing as how it took you by surprise. Is there anything going on his life that may have put him into a negative mindset? Perhaps he's having problems in a relationship or at work that is leading him to rabbit holes on the internet.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I'm so sorry to hear that. He might be struggling with that and looking to shift his negative feelings onto another issue, one that has the support of many. It could be providing him comfort to be angry at the suppression of Twitter rather than coming to terms with his own turmoil. I think talking to him about his job status might be a start in reasoning his new outlook.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Gently. It's never a good idea to press the issue, especially if it seems like he's trying to avoid it.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Perhaps you should implore the help of somebody else in his life. I understand wanting to help your friend, especially when it's negatively impacting your own mental health, but there's only so much one person can do. You both deserve to be in a good head space and asking for help is okay.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I'm sure she might already be concerned as well. It might be easier than you expect. If he's consistently getting in arguments with you, it's likely that he's stuck in a negative haze and it might be affecting his other relationships.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Try having a private conversation with her and don't ask her to talk to him, merely push her in that direction. It's less plotting and more seeing her point of view as well.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I'm glad to have given you some steps that may help you!<|endoftext|>
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing",I am Tom.  How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance?<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,I worked in a library many years.....<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,You can support your family by working at the library and reading up on higher paying jobs while there.<|endoftext|>

"Question,Self-disclosure","I understand. What are you struggling with concerning time management? I have also struggled with time management. I have found that reminders on my phone, and a planner have been most beneficial to me personally. I understand every situation is different. Do you have a deadline you're trying to meet?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I can see how this would be very overwhelming. I have a child learning virtually as well. Similarly, I am a student. I am not working on my masters degree... I can't even imagine.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Is your child old enough to do some of it on their own? I have ""independent"" or ""together"" next to each task. I purchased a large magnetic chalk board for our fridge. If your child is to young to do this I could see how this would be much more challenging for you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I completely understand how you feel. Virtual learning has affected our daily goals, though we are doing prerecorded lessons. That does make it easier I am sure. I have a 10 and 2 year old at home with me. One thing that has helped me is support groups. There are so many moms going through the same thing we are at this time.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"You are not alone in this. You could take the 3 year old to another room if possible and work on phonics/numbers, then help the older children during naptime. Then maybe they could help entertain the 3 year old while you work on your own schoolwork? This is similar to my daily schedule... but as you know with kids you have to go with the flow most of the time.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It helps so much to talk to other moms who understand. Being a mom is hard enough without all the added extra stress of 2020. It sounds like you're doing the best you can, and your kids will remember that in the long run. You can do this!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Why have you been feeling stressed and anxious?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sure you tried your best on that test, as long as you study hard I believe you can ace those next 2 exams!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I've heard that meditation can help with stress and focus, maybe you could try meditating for a bit before you study?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Meditation is essentially focussing on breathing, you could start by closing your eyes and slowly breathe in an out.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"From what you're saying to me, I feel that you don't believe in yourself very much.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I've struggled with the same thing before, whenever I doubt myself I look back at all i've accomplished and look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I can do it. It has worked well for me.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Psychologies studies show that spacing out your studying and relearning helps you remember more information, you could try to section off your studying and then reviewing information before the exam!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sure you'll do your best and pass that exam with flying colors!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I have two actually! 1. Do not procrastinate as that will only cause you more stress and 2. Believe in yourself! I know you can do it, you should too!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Of course! I'm glad you're feeling more confident!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello! How are you today?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh no, I am so sorry to hear you are going through this difficulty. I am here to help and lend a sympathetic ear.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I think there is a way to handle any situation. Have you had an honest and open conversation with your wife on both of your feelings on the matter?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","I am so sorry to hear that your wife has cancer. I have had an ill loved one and I know how difficult that can be, not just for the person going through it but for the family too. How do you feel about not having any more kids?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I see. And is it a deal breaker for you if you cannot have any more kids? Would you be willing to stay with your wife and be content with the children you already have?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","I understand, it is a very difficult situation. What is more important to you? Your relationship with your wife or having another child?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes, it's tough. Maybe you should think about both scenarios and write down how it would make you feel. Picture being without your wife and how would that make you feel. Then picture being with your wife and your current family and how that would make you feel.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Of course, I am here for whatever you need.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Maybe you can tell your wife that?<|endoftext|>
Question,For sure. Is there anything else I can help with?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,me too.<|endoftext|>
Question,Great! What’s going on?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Lack of sleep will definitely make you tired during the day!  Is there something bothering you that causes you to stay awake during the night?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Well it sounds like you’re tired enough for sleep, but you’re still wired and can’t get the sleep you need.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are you getting any physical activity in during the day to make body more willing to cooperate?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I’ve found that physical activity helps me to get to sleep even when I’m troubled mentally.  Another option is to slow your brain down so that your mind is relaxed.  That is much harder for me though!<|endoftext|>
Information,"That sounds like a good plan!  It also helps to make sure that it’s dark and very quiet.  Surprisingly enough, when they did research on sleep disorders they found that a lot of people just needed quiet and darkness.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Yep, I’ve tried a LOT of things.  I’m currently struggling with this myself.  I’m even trying out melatonin, tryptophan, and even CBD (not stoney weed oil)!  So far no success, but I’m still trying!<|endoftext|>"
Information,"It’s one of the reasons that it’s good to get outside.  Your body makes melatonin from sunshine, so going for a walk outside helps in 2 ways!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Getting good sleep is critical.  Supplementing with melatonin might help compensate for your lack of sunshine!<|endoftext|>
Others,Glad I could help.<|endoftext|>
Question,Anytime.  Is there anything else you wanted to discuss?<|endoftext|>
Others,My pleasure!  Hope your day goes well.  Sweet dreams!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's good to hear.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I'm doing great, thank you!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anything that you wanted to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm so sorrry to hear. that. Is there any reason for it?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That's so hard. Was there any cause for the arguing or is it just general tension?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"THat's so hard. My best friend hated my ex boyfriend as well and we always fought about it. I tried really hard to understand where she was coming from. IN the end, she was right about somethings. What was really helpful for me, was having us all spend time together so she could get to know him.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You should try setting up a fun day for them where they can get to know each other.<|endoftext|>
Question,Bowling is gret!! would your best friend be open ot it?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's great!!! this way you can keep them both in your life.<|endoftext|>
Question,Anytime! Do you need anything ese?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, I am well.  What can I help you with this evening?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Are you upset about a specific issue or is it a general feeling of ""blue""?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's a really hard experience to go through, I'm sorry you are having to go through that. That's a really hard experience to go through, I'm sorry you are having to go through that.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I had a bad break-up a few years ago, and took it very easy on myself for a few weeks afterward.  I let myself eat whatever I wanted, and have what physical comforts I could find while my mind and my heart healed. I tried to avoid alcohol, because that will just increase depression and anxiety.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think you are the only person who can decide when you are ready to start dating again, but I would encourage you to try to keep it light and casual at first.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Strengthen yourself and your boundaries and pursue your interests.  I got into boxing and it's a great way to get in shape and have an emotional release.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I rehabbed a bunch of my houseplants.  I had some really sad looking pothos plants and I started reading about how to revitalize them. I got them healthy enough to start a second generation from cuttings, and it was such simple, calm work, it was almost like meditation.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That is totally understandable, and I think you can do it.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You will find someone that will be a better fit, that is to be sure.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That could be fun and validating for you!  It's always nice to get some attention.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Information",I totally understand. The pandemic is once in a lifetime event and it has turned all our lives upside down. I hope you are aware about the potential vaccines with great success rate announced my major pharma companies.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, there seems to be some credibility to the claim - the effectiveness of the vaccine. So I would say even though it seems a lot difficult, there is some hope early next year.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I understand your concern. In fact, a lot of people have questioned the effectiveness given how fast it was developed. Are you anxious because you have to provide for your family besides yourself?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I too, have been working from home for the past 9 months. And I am the sole provider for my family. So I understand how frustrating this can be.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Information","The key, however, is our mindset and how we approach the problem. If you are afraid about going our during peak hours, you can step outside during non-peak hours. This is just an example. Everybody's situations and preferences vary. I am frustrated, but I cannot cultivate inaction. Because I have mouths to feed. So I have developed a mindset to tackle the problem by taking all the precautions I possible can.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"In essence, I know the factors under my control, and I try to control them and work them in my favour. I make it a point not to worry too much about factors outside my control.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Information,Providing Suggestions","Because it's a new situation to most of the world's population! People take time to adjust. You take care of factors under your control - wearing a mask , social distancing when outside and washing/sanitizing hands whenever you can. Try not to pay too much attention to factors OUTSIDE your control - how many people are there and if social distancing is followed to the letter by OTHERS.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","Ya, that might be the root cause. Talk with your partner and try going out when you and them feel it is safe to do so. Start cautiously, then slowly return to your ""normal"" outdoor times. It can be intimidating at first, but if you don't try, you may never be able to overcome the anxiety or fear.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am sure there are, but make sure those groups are social distancing as well. We are all in this together and we can definitely overcome it :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes. You can distract yourself with music or comedy shows. Or a long lost hobby. After all, one good thing about COVID is, it has put more time on our plates.<|endoftext|>"
Others,It was nice chatting with you as well. Take care and stay safe.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Hello how are you?  I am here to support you.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Self-disclosure",How can I help support you today? I know these are tough times and we all need to be heard.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I understand.  I have had to stay by myself for most of the year due to the pandemic.  That has been hard.<|endoftext|>
Others,Have you tried different games that help you get to know each other?  Maybe try a movie or series.  I loved Sweet Magnolia's on Netflix.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings",Oh my goodness.  The good thing is there is a moratorium on evictions so she would not be able to do that legally.  CNN can be overwhelming.  Try giving her some type of distraction.  Suggest yoga or some type of bonding. I think 24/7 news is problematic but here to stay.<|endoftext|>
Information,As long as you have property there she would have to formally evict you.  That is the good news.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Information",I think it is best to stick with a short local news report. My pleasure.  So many people are worried about losing their place to stay but thankfully most are protected due to the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Check Youtube videos on using Panda's.  It will help you make more money.  I have done over 750,000 hits.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You are welcome.  Panda's help you keep grabbing hits.  You can store 25 at a time.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Have a great night and take care of yourself.  It has been a pleasure.<|endoftext|>
Question,Was there anything that leads to this?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",That's terrible and unacceptable behavior. How long have you been together?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",That sucks. I wouldn't be able to accept either. Have you talked to your friends about this?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question","It is understandable to have that reaction. I agree with you, only us can hep ourselves. Have you tried doing activities that help distract you from having negative thoughts?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","Haha I feel you, I tend to eat a lot when depressed too. Look, it's treat yourself method. You deserve the best. If you can go to the mountain or big lake, I would say try spending a few hours there. Maybe have a mini picnic by yourself and enjoy the nature.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Is there anything you have wanted to do but don't have the time? I always want to learn guitar and baking. This is the best time to start that.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's the spirit! I know being treated like that feels horrible. However, I bet you have mourned enough, at the end of the day, a person treats you like that has no respect and you shouldn't waste time on them. It's time to invest in yourself, once you become your better version, a better partner will come to you.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Yes!Actually don't think you did wrong. Reflecting after a relationship is good but don't put all the blame on yourself. You have learned from this relationship too i believe, use that for your next one.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hi! How are you today?<|endoftext|>
Information,Finals can be so stressful. Have you been studying?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","I can imagine. When i was in school , i had the same thing happen to me. I was so sterssed, it led to me nto being able to focus. What really helped me was practicing mindfulness. Are there any exercies that you like doing?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you made time to do that latey?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Definitely, exercise is a really good way to de-stress. It releases endorphins which can calm you and make you happy. This is a great way to reset before studying.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"HAve you tried setting small study goals? That always helps me. I set a hour for one small topic at a time , it makes studying less overwhelming.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Not necessarily studying less but break the 6 finals into smaller tasks. Use index cards to organize yourself. I alwyas start with an outline of topics i need to cover then put them onto index cards.<|endoftext|>
Question,That's up to you. WIll your employer be accommodating about taking a day or two off? You want to make sure to not lose your job.<|endoftext|>

Others,I like comedy movies.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's quite all right. The wait times can be a bit long. How are you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Working from home is not what people expected. Many have found themselves isolated. They miss the interaction of the office. How long have you bee working from home?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Have you and your co-workers talked to your boss about a hybrid schedule, maybe a couple days a week in the office? That might work.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I see. That's a concern. So you feel that if one person goes in to the office, then everyone else will have to? There won't be any flexibility?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Hm. A bit of a dilemma. Can this situation go on forever though? Maybe the boss will extend the stay-at-home for a while, but when other companies go back to the office, the expectation will be there for all companies. Other employees might change their minds bit by bit as well.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,True. I don't think you are alone. Is there something that you can do to make working at home better for you? More frequent breaks? Better work space?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,True. It might be easier to work at home when you have a chance to get out of the house during your free time.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Most people didn't plan for the long term because nobody thought that this was a sustainable way to work. By the way, if your company wants you to stay home, then it might help buy the equipment you need to be productive.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think if you talk to your co-workers, they'll have ideas for upgrading your workspace.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think that's a great idea! People probably want to connect without having to talk about work. Later on, they might want to do the same thing but face-to-face.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Sure! My pleasure. Best of luck with all that! Have a great weekend!<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,Personally I took three years longer than it should to get my degree and accrued some debt because of it. Although I feel it is worth it now.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I'm hearing its difficult for you knowing that you are on a path that you don't really want to be on.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,A lot of people I know benefited from talking to an advisor or counselor for some direction. Have you done that recently?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"What about meeting with the counselor with your parents, since it seems they would need to support you financially over any extra time it might take?<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,It can be very good yes. Have you tried any other sort of gig work?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Oh wow, that is really bad. At least there aren't very many people there .. I think it's mainly research people.<|endoftext|>"

Self-disclosure,I have been in toxic relationships before and to be honest it does sound a little as though this is one of those situations.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways.<|endoftext|>

Information,"I understand completely. Depression runs in my family and if it goes untreated, can scare anyone that is involved. You can try suggesting that he talks to a close friend, family member, or counselor to talk about how he is feeling and ways to cope with it. Sometimes medication could be a good way to fix the chemical imbalance that can cause depression.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You could start a conversation by saying that you just want to check on him and see if he is okay and how he is doing. You don't want to start the conversation by immediately telling him to get help, as he might just get defensive.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I don't believe it will upset him if you ease into suggesting that he should talk to someone he is close to or seeing a professional. Your main goal is to check on him and make sure that he is okay since he seems to want to be alone and not talk to anyone. Once he tells you how he is doing you could mention that even talking to someone about his thoughts and feelings could lift a weight off his shoulders. If he seems that he doesn't really know why he feels the way does, you could suggest that medically speaking, sometimes our brains don't produce the chemicals that we need them to and it could make us feel bad. Seeing a professional to get their opinion would also help greatly.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Information",It's very hard to see someone we care about go through this. Communication is one of the best medicines there is to help someone feel better.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Even just trying to talk to him to see how he is doing will show him that care about him. I'm sure that once he is talking to someone about his thoughts and feelings, he will start to get back to his old self.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,In what way are you not happy? Can you elaborate?<|endoftext|>
Information,Problems often arise in relationships over misunderstanding each others point of view.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I completely agree with you. One sided relationships do not work.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"What else besides unhappy do you feel about this breakup? Often there are a mix of emotions and looking at all of them is important to see the whole picture. People often report feeling relieved, regretful or other emotions with the feeling of unhappy.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What are some things that you enjoyed doing before this relationship?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Reaching out to old friends is a great idea to be able to regain some joy in life.<|endoftext|>
Information,Many books have suggested that we are allowed to disclose what we want in relationships with friends. So if it is not something you wish to talk about with your friends tell them that and they should be willing to accept it. However I do understand if you do not want to reconnect with friends.<|endoftext|>
Question,I understand. What have you tried to overcome your depression?<|endoftext|>
Information,"I think what I meant are there things that you have done, that while you are doing them, you are not actively feeling depressed? Many people say that going for walks, taking a cooking class, starting a new hobby are ways they have stopped thinking about their depression and found some relief from it.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,In the past when I have dealt with depression following a breakup I have taken up a new hobby. I found I liked crochet. I made a blanket that I still have today.<|endoftext|>
Others,That is good to hear. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Others,It was nice talking to you.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,Sorry to hear you're upset. Want to share why you're feeling that way?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you feel like you can't take any actions in the situation?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That sounds frustrating, especially if you're one of the employees affected and when the new boss doesn't seem to know what he/she is doing with the reorganization. That's positive, though, that you at least have a strategy in mind with retirement, even if this may not be the best time right now.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you are not the only worker who is seriously questioning the changes being made.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Wow! From what you've said, it sounds like your coworkers feel much as you do about the changes.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That must be tough, but it must help to at least commiserate through the phone calls and be able to relate to each other.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","My former spouse works for a company that has moved him to departments he needed to retrain to work in, and he is considering looking for a different job, maybe after COVID is outta here. It sounds like you're determined to stay as positive as possible while considering other options, such as a new job. Doing something about it like this must feel a little better.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"You're welcome! I also think that's wise to hold off on retirement until your daughter is through college. My oldest is ready for college and I don't feel ready to leave work, either.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,You can do it!<|endoftext|>
Others,You too! G'night.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there something you want to discuss?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So it sounds like the birthday is a time for self-reflection, and you're not happy with where you are right now?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is this something you've felt on previous birthdays?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","I'll confess I have felt the same way, especially with ""milestone"" birthdays (30, 40, 50, etc.). Do you think you are possibly expect too much in terms of achievements?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"As I became older, i started to wonder what terms like  ""normal people"" and being ""average"" really mean. Am I comparing myself to something that even exists?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","That's so true. It's tough to deal with. But I will same, as I became older, I just stopped caring as much about what other's think. It just happened.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Also, I'm sure there are some things in life you are good at, even if those aren't what society seems to value.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Yeah, I hear you. Are you talking to others -  such as professionals, etc. - about your autism?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Being ""forced"" to do anything is usually a turn off. But it's good to hear there are groups online to help.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Oh, thanks. It's always nice to have a real conversation with someone.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","I haven't planned on it, but I am looking for a career change. But no, this wasn't training for me. Not sure what this simulation is all about :).<|endoftext|>"

Others,Take care.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That is an extremely tough situation to go through, I'm sorry to hear that.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","Yes, job applications can feel particularly demeaning to complete.  Personally, I get frustrated with all the repetition and then repetitive rejection.  It seems like I had no value. But you have to consider that there are dozens of different reasons why you don't get selected for a job, and quite a few of them have nothing to do with you , either as a person or as an employee.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","No, don't think that.  I know of several employers that have actually said they don't want employees smarter than them.  It requires more money and more management, and quite a few people are very happy to not do either of those things for ostensibly higher quality workforce. On an actionable level, have you been getting blocked at the application point or the interviewing point?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I see.  Maybe there are some qualification programs in your local area, or maybe at the local university or college where you could take classes?  There is a career development center at my local university that is open to everyone, maybe you could see if they would review your resume and give you some objective feedback?  Students love a good live subject :-).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You should explore what resources your city/county/province may offer for job seekers.  It is in the best interest of almost every community that its members have have jobs and feel useful, so you may find some valuable information and maybe some connections. Oh!  And what I always tell everyone who is looking for a job:  Apply UP!  Don't ever think is something above your level.  Apply UP!  They may admire your temerity and invite you for an interview just to see who you think you are :-).<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","I am glad to hear you are feeling a little better!  Yes, bad management is so toxic.  Even with great coworkers in a job you love, horrible management can ruin it quickly. You seem like you are open to trying new solutions and putting in the effort to up your competitive level.  Stay positive and take care of yourself mentally and physically, and I think you will be successful.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","I was in a similar situation, nothing was ever good enough, and we were never given enough information to succeed anyhow. I am glad to hear that!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is awesome :-).<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",How may I help you? I am doing good ... thanks..<|endoftext|>

Question,Are you looking for job?<|endoftext|>
Question,How did you prepare your resume? Have you had it revieed by any professional resume writer?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"When you submit resume, first it is scanned by a software for key words. Are you sure you have all the right key words, so that the scanning software picks it up?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If you don't have the right key words, it may not be picked up. The professional resume writers typically run the resume through the scanning software and make sure it is picked up at least 90% of the time. For some businesses, COVID might be an issue.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"yes, you need to compile keywords... from the potential job postings. ..and add them to your resume somehow...<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,that's for sure..<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you getting call from the employers?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,good.. then keyword is not the issue..<|endoftext|>
"Question,Providing Suggestions",Are you getting interview call? I hope thigs will work out for you.<|endoftext|>
Information,I think the situation will get better soon...<|endoftext|>
Question,Anything else I could help you with?<|endoftext|>
Others,thanks.. have a good day.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Oh no, I am very sorry to hear about that. Can you tell me more about your situation?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are being bullied at work. Is that right?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I can definitely understand why that would e so stressful for you. It hurts when your hard work goes unrecognized.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Have you tried asking your boss for a one on one talk where you can talk about ways you can improve? I did that before and I found that it was super helpful in seeing a new perspective about me. And please don't think you are disliked because you are obese. I can assure you, you are beautiful.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Okay, well maybe that may be a good place to start with your boss? I think it will be a great place to start. Sometimes it helps to reach out and hear other's perspective of you. What do you think about that suggestion? Are you hesitant about it?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,And I think everyone is beautiful. You are definitely right about beauty being relative. I personally choose to see the beauty in everything and it has made life a lot more beautiful for me.<|endoftext|>
Question,That's great! How about your coworkers. Do you feel like it might be worth talking to them about what they have been doing to you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I see, I understand how difficult it would feel to talk to people who have been treating you like that. :(.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I am sorry to hear that. It must be even more difficult in a pandemic time. When did this happen? If you don't mind telling me more about it.<|endoftext|>
Others,How are you doing recently? Do you have any coping mechanism that you can share with me? I can lend you an ear.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I went through the same process. I understand what you are feeling. I am glad that you are on Mechanical Turk and interacting with people. Which area do you live in? It is springtime and pretty outside. Have you thought about walking more walks?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Yeah, I like to clear my head by taking a walk. I know it is a temporary relief, but it helps regulate my mood. Do you live with people, do you have conversation with people regularly?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you know what you are doing and you have a support system of your choice. Do you share stories like breaking up with girlfriend with them?<|endoftext|>
Information,"I have the same tendency. I don't feel comfortable imposing my struggle and my thoughts with people. I would personally recommend you sharing a little bit more with family during Easter. It doesn't have to be the intimate details of the breakup, it can be generic feeling, like loneliness.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I am glad that you find it helpful. I wish I can be around to hear more about it.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope you all the best.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,No. I actually recommend a book called It is ok that you are not OK. It helped me personally and makes me a more emotionally intelligent person.<|endoftext|>
Question,Very little to complain about today. What brings you here?<|endoftext|>
Others,How's the weather where you are?<|endoftext|>
Question,Exactly the same.  What are you doing to stay warm?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Well you're resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Is it the stress of the pandemic getting to you & your family, or something else?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can you share?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","That's completely your decision, but it can bring us down at times.  What are you doing to stay positive during these crazy times in the world? I know you mentioned feeling lazy.  Sometimes I make a list of things in the morning that I want  to accomplish.  Even if I get one done, it's a win.  :-).<|endoftext|>"
Information,A hobby could be another outlet for you in addition to talking to your friends online.  You don't have to put too much pressure on yourself for it to be productive.  What hobby ideas do you have?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"What a great idea about learning new skills.  It would be a great investment of your time, as well as improve your human capital.  Win-win.  Can you make a plan to research some places where you can sign-up for a coding class?  Maybe research the next few days, and commit to starting in the nest 2-3 weeks?  You would also meet others like yourself online also trying to learn a new skill.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,I have found that keeping in touch via phone text zoom is helpful.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"i get it. i've doubled down on the vitamin D and one of those ""happy lights"" so that seasonal depression is less for us.<|endoftext|>"

"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",I understand you keep experiencing anxiety attacks. Is there any common cause for the attacks?<|endoftext|>

Information,"I understand, Sometimes the Mindfulness exercises help me get more productive sleep.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I did, ASMR guidance seems to help me most, but I happen to be ASMR sensative, perhaps you are as well? They seem to help with my anxiety as well.<|endoftext|>"

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","Well, it sounds like you are doing pretty well given the circumstances. It is good that you have found activities to keep busy. I understand the lack of structure. It can be difficult but also freeing.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It can be a good time to try a project or new direction you haven't had time for until now. Or just try to think of what your possibilities are.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I have a good feeling that we will have some normalcy by summer 2021.<|endoftext|>

Others,Good. Thank you for asking. What brings you to talk today?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I can understand how that is upsetting. What about the job do you find unfulfilling?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I understand. It seems to me you are a proactive person who enjoys continuing work to obtain a goal. Is that correct?<|endoftext|>

Question,Is there a specific path or event in the future that you are worried about?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Things are very uncertain these days.  I certainly have never experienced anything like it.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Personally, I have tried to lessen my anxiety by limiting my intake of news and social media.  No matter what one might believe, there's always someone out there that's apparently going to take it to an extreme, and reading over and over about that is emotionally exhausting.<|endoftext|>"

Others,"A routine has been really really helpful.  I also make sure to get plenty of sunshine.  As the winter comes in, we have shorter days and it feels suffocating.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That must be frustrating.  I've learned there are just some people I can't trust with my vulnerabilities.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"But again, you cannot control how they react, you can only control yourself.  And that's not to say you can turn off your emotions or anything, but once you let go of the idea that you can control someone else to your liking, you will feel better.  Less out of control.  Because that's a lot of what is disturbing about the pandemic.  We have zero control over it.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Sure thing, I wish you luck, and thank you for the compliment :-).<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I'm doing well, thanks. Why are you only doing okay, and not great?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Many people are at this time. Is there anything in particular that is bothering you?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Me too, winter can be rough. Do the people around you value your work?<|endoftext|>"

Question,Are there any comparably paid jobs that you could take that do not involve moving?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I do understand that the job market is really difficult right now. Would your siblings not be able to take care of your parents though?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you feel that they are not committed enough to your parents?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",It is very difficult to know what to say. It is a big worry and I wonder if you can be happy in your new environment if you can't be sure that what you've left behind is okay. Is it possible that you are worrying unnecessarily though?<|endoftext|>
Information,Have you considered looking into other forms of help that your parents could have when you are not there? There are organisations that could check in on them.<|endoftext|>

Question,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking! Do you mind me asking what's going on that's making you feel sad?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you feel as though you are being personally attacked/mistreated for something that you feel you handled correctly. Does that summarize what you're feeling?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I feel as though you absolutely did the right thing! If I were in your shoes, I would have done the exact same thing.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I have neighbors who act in similar ways. They act as though they run the entire street, but they rent just like everyone else does here. Dealing with them can be very difficult at times.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","Just based on what you're saying, I can completely understand why you feel the way that you do. In my opinion, you have every right to feel that way. Haha! It's not fun at all to have neighbors who make you feel as though you're somehow less than them. I know exactly what that feels like.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions","I do know people who have gone through the exact same thing in the past. When another animal attacks one of your fur-babies, it's absolutely terrible. However, the fact that this woman was given the option to either get rid of her dog or move tells me that you are 100% correct in the way that you handled this situation. It's unfortunate for the woman, yes, but she should have had more control over her dog. It's bad enough when one animal is attacked, but when it's more than one, that's when you really know that it's a problem. Again, legally, she had to make a choice, and that's because she failed to properly secure her dog. I really don't feel as though you did anything wrong. If I were you, I would ask to speak with the neighbors who have an issue with you face-to-face. I know it may be difficult, but I think that would be the best way to go about it. Are you on good terms with the other person whose dog was attacked?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That probably has a lot to do with it. I would feel sorry for her too, as it is very sad in general. However, it doesn't excuse the fact that her animal attacked two other dogs.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","That is absolutely terrible. In that case, I would just tell them that you refuse to allow another dog to possible injure or kill your own dog, so you did what was necessary to protect your fur-baby. Had you not done anything, this could have happened again, and the outcome may have been much worse. At that point, if they still don't respond kindly, I'd tell them that you still feel as though you did what needed to be done, that you understand why they are upset, but that you will always do whatever it takes to protect your dog. Hopefully, they will stop being mean. Even if they just stop talking to you completely, it's better than them harassing you or something along those lines. If they do start escalating their nasty behavior, I'd let the manager of your complex know that you're being mistreated. I always try to keep things calm and quiet, but I refuse to be taken advantage of or treated poorly. Personally, as I stated previously, I wholeheartedly believe that you did the right thing. If they're unable to see that, I'd try to just avoid contact with them unless it's necessary. I know it stinks and I'd be sad too, but unfortunately, some people just don't know how to let things go and seem to find joy in making other people upset. I'm so sorrry that you're dealing with all of this.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I'm so glad that I was able to offer helpful suggestions! Hang in there. You sound like a strong person! I would definitely spend some time with your true friends who live outside of your neighborhood. I can assure you that if someone else's animal attacked one of mine, I would have done the exact same thing that you did.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're very welcome! You do the same. Have a wonderful day. Try to do things that make you smile! :).<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"I could understand how that could make you very angry, I would be too.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I have not, it sounds like a very bad situation. Is there anyone you can report this to at the company?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you are working in a toxic work environment with poor leadership. Have you considered possibly seeking another job? Or maybe another company?<|endoftext|>
Others,I understand. What do you think about having a conversation with the board and let them know the issues you are having? You could have your coworker back you up.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you take a lot of pride in your job which is very amiable. I think confronting the board is the best way to go about this.<|endoftext|>
Others,"It's very possible, but I think you will be commended amongst your peers. You owe it to yourself not to be walked all over.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"And who knows maybe the board will appreciate you coming to them, it shows great strength.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"You're very welcome, was there anything else you wanted to discuss?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Okay I hope I was able to help, good luck!<|endoftext|>"
Question,What happened?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I'm sorry to hear that, when was it?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"that sucks, did you tell your family?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"it's ok even if they can't really help, having someone to share your problem is good enough.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Of course, anyone would feel the same. Maybe you should take a short trip, camping or go fishing to clear your mind for now.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","I think after you feel calmer then you can look for job. When we are desperate, we are unable to judge which option is good. Absolutely, having friends right now is the best.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"you can drink a bit but be careful, people get addicted to alcohol during depression happens very often.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"give yourself a week or two, what done is done, you can use this time as a break for yourself!<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,good luck on finding a new job!<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you want to tell me more about it?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",I can understand that... Did you lose your job because of this?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Ouch, that's no good...  I understand medical issues can cause all kinds of problems in our lives.<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",I understand.. has the quality of your life improved?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",It's the small things that add up to a big picture.. How is your Christmas going?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well that is cool, I'm sure that will help take your mind off of some stuff. I am a runner. I like to run when I get stressed out.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I understand having Substance Abuse issues. I was in a family with the some issues. It is tough on everybody I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",I am very familiar with it. Do you have a large support group?<|endoftext|>

Question,Any other questions or concerns that you may have for me?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Self-disclosure","Well, how do you adapt to the work issue? Do you like dogs? There are opportunities for dog walkers. I made good money in the past walking my neighbors and friends dogs.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","When I get stressed, I try to do vigorous exercises with pushups, chin ups, sit ups or walking fast. Do you have a place that you can walk briskly in your area of town?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Losing a job? It never happened for you before?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would join a support group for those people who need support and want to change careers. There are support groups online to help with job loss who can advise you on where to use your interests and skills  to have a more fulfilling life.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Well, what other questions or concerns do you have for me?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","I feel that you have really expressed the important things in your life that you need to. I am proud of you. I have been down, but I reached out to support groups.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I felt good to help you in December 2020.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I understand that you are feeling down and blue and that isn't good. What is making you feel down and blue do you think?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I've struggled with alcohol before too and understand how tough it is to not drink especially during a tough time like after losing a job. Don't beat yourself up, it's only natural and you have the power to get through this trying time.<|endoftext|>"
Question,How long ago did you lose your job?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",My advice is to try to talk to your family and explain to them that you lost your job and are feeling down. While they may not accept it at first it is a good start to try to give them some context for why you are drinking. Alcohol is a way of self medicating; some people find it helpful to talk to a doctor to get an actual prescription for a medication to help. I personally stopped drinking once my doctor found the correct medication for me. That allowed me to be happy without drinking.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Talk to who you feel most comfortable with. Start off easy. Hopefully they can help you then talk to the other parent. I am sure your parents have once had a period in life where they were down and blue and can relate to what you are going through.<|endoftext|>
Others,You are welcome. Best of luck! I believe you have to end the conversation as I am not able to. I am here to keep on talking too if you would like.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have done both; I have gone periods of 6-12 months having nothing to drink and then when I could control it I would allow myself to have drinks on special occasions. I tried not to drink during the week and only once on the weekend at most.<|endoftext|>
Others,You are welcome. Have a nice day!<|endoftext|>
Question,Would you like to give me a few more details?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Well, are you sure that he could have definitely afforded to loan you anything?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","Well, the thing is, just because you had lent to him does not mean he is obliged to help you. Though of course it would have been the courteous thing to do.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is it possible to try to talk to him calmly and tell him exactly how he has made you feel?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I think you need to decide whether you just just let it go or whether you cant' and won't be able to continue the friendship.<|endoftext|>
Question,Aren't you worried that it might rankle with you and surface again at some time to affect the friendship?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It is understandable. I hope that I have been able to help you a little and thank you for talking it out!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you thought of trying any meditation exercises or breathing exercises... just to help you stay calm?<|endoftext|>

Question,Hello. How are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I'm doing well, thanks for asking. Do you know what's might be causing these feelings of anxiety and fatigue?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That must be very distressing to have the same nightmare every night. Do you have a nighttime routine to help you get to rest in a more relaxed state?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I'm sorry to hear that you haven't had success with routines. I have suffered with sleeplessness due to bad dreams as well. I find doing yoga with meditative breathing allows me to clear my mind, and sleep better. Do you practice any meditation?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Having high anxiety makes it very hard to concentrate on meditation. I take a medication for anxiety that has helped me a lot. Have you talked to your doctor about your anxiety?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I'm really sorry you weren't able to get relief with medication. I understand that having someone to talk to can be a relief when you feel so anxious. Do you have any close friends or family that you can talk to more often?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I'm sure your friend is glad to be able to lend a listening ear. Sometimes we need to hash out our problems more than once to resolve them. Do you like to exercise? It can be a great way to relieve anxiety and exhaust your body so you sleep better.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Question","I'm so glad to hear you have some outlet for your anxiety that helps with your sleep. Keeping your body healthy can be a great start to getting your mind in a more calm space. If you don't mind me asking, do you work a lot of hours outside your home?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I see. Being at home alone most of the time, even when you have virtual meetings, may be contributing to your anxiety. Maybe you could meet up with friends in person at a park or other outdoor location. Is that possible?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's great! I'm glad you are getting plenty of socialization during this difficult time.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you like music? It can be a great way to wind down instead of looking at screens before bedtime.<|endoftext|>

Question,I'm doing good! Have you been struggling with anything lately?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","That sounds like a hard decision to make, I recently went through a very similar situation with my employer. Money issues are hard to deal with because it affects our livelihood. Is it possible for you to receive a raise from your current job?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you are really stressed over the future possibilities. It also seems like you love you job now so it may be hard to leave.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Are there any better paying jobs near you that you think you could enjoy just as much?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you have a good understanding of the different possibilities that you have. It also sounds like it may be more stressful for you to leave your current job.<|endoftext|>

Question,What are you stressed about?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh, Covid is really having a negative affect on a lot of students, right now. Has school from home had anegative affect on you?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It's interesting that you find being home more distracting than being away in a dorm.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure,Question","Yeah sometimes families can struggle with the idea of boundaries. I also went away to school for similar reasons, but I actually found college life way more distracting tbh. Have you told your family about the issues your having?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","OK, that makes sense. Have you spoken tried speaking to your teachers.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Okay, then I think you need to find a place you can claim for yourself. Either you can tell set up a study schedule with your parents and request to not be contacted during that time frame, then if they don't seem to have the ability to abide by that, you could try the outdoor seating of a starbucks or even an ikea or library.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hi there, how can I help you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"OK, sure. Can you tell me what the problem is? I'll do my best to help.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","I can understand that. It must be an important exam for you. Do you enjoy calculus? I'm terrible at anything with numbers, myself!<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",A B is a great result! Are there any revision courses that you can access to help refresh your skills?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure",This pandemic has really made it difficult to get anything done hasn't it. Do you know of anyone else who is looking to take the course that you got revise together with? I always find it easier to work through things like this with someone else.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"There seem to be some really good online courses out there. It might be worth sending out enquiries to a number of tutors, asking them to get in touch as soon as they are free, and in the meantime working through something online to help build up your confidence?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I bet once you get into it again it will all come back to you. Sometimes getting started is the hardest part.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think that if you got a B once, you can do it again, and if you really want it, which you clearly do, you can do anything! Aim for an A, you can do it!<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,Don't quit your job because it will only make life harder in the long run.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Being competent is good and you will surely get compensation for the amount of work you put in, maybe a promotion.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You could always work harder and show them you can work, maybe then they will offer you a promotion. You can manage your anxiety by maybe meditating, it seems you have a lot going on so it would help to forget about things for a while.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It is always hard to hear any bad feedback, do you feel that you could speak with your manager about it and try to resolve the feelings?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings",Could you possibly go to her and tell her that you have heard the feed back and you are sorry to hear that it bothers her that you did not realize it and it is something you will work on becoming more aware of. You seem like such a nice person i am sure if you approached it the right way you would not cause any damage.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Going to another manager may be a great idea! Maybe the manager could address the issue with her and help her to realize there is nothing wrong with a having happy employee like yourself.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Yes i can see where that would be a problem.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Do you think you could speak to this other manager about possibly transferring positions so you are not working under your current manager?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Well you have a right to feel how you do, everyone takes things differently. It would bother me but i would proably try to get to know her better to see why she has such a problem with others being happy, maybe she has some problems going on in her life and has no one to share these problems with if she is not happy it may come as a struggle to see others happy all the time.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I would let her know nicely that some things she said has been hurtful and ask if there is anything on her mind that she would like to chat about that you would be glad to talk with her.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes you are such a positive person that i think you being supportive will help open up communication, and yes you should make it known that she has said something that has affected you personally and in addressing it may help her not treat others that way in the future.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"From my personal experience, I can say that your support really means everything to her. She may not want to admit the truth to herself, but with your support, I believe she can find the strength to get out of the relatioship.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",Yes I completely understand. It's a very delicate situation. I've read multiple times that it takes an average of 7 times to leave an abusive relationship (even though I think I tried even more times than that). She will hopefully one day gather the courage to realize she doesn't deserve to be treated badly. You are amazing for being her support!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's seriously great to hear! I don't know what the exact situation is but I do know that she needs all the love she can get.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Others","that's all you can do for now until the day that she will be able to take steps to leave the bad situation.

Providing Suggestions,Have you tried virtual ways of connecting with friends and family? I know that has been useful for me.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That is understandable. Hopefully with the vaccine, we will be able to see others in public soon. Have you tried some of the virtual visual apps such as Zoom or FaceTime?<|endoftext|>"

Others,Wow that is so exciting! I would love to hear more about your grandchild.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Yes definitely! That is wonderful, I am sure she looks forward to meeting you. And luckily with Facebook you are able to get updates and to virtually see her.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,I understand why that can have you worried. Have you been told this is a possibility?<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you talked to co workers or others about this?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,This is a worry that many others are having right now. Maybe there is an online group that deals in this type of worry.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"If your company has that, otherwise there are online chat groups that would.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I don't have any experience in this area but I am sure that an online search would be easy.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I don't think that worrying about it ever does any good. All you can do is do your job well and display your worth to the company.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I usually find that taking action is a better idea than worrying.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Don't forget there are always options if something does happen.<|endoftext|>
Others,Glad that I could help. Try to focus on positives.<|endoftext|>
Others,It's been very nice talking to you.Take care.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So things haven't been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I'm sorry to hear that. That's a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock?<|endoftext|>
Question,And the teacher wouldn't budge?<|endoftext|>
Question,Was this for a course that was required for a major?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ok, if you're willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn't work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it's offered.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside. But I pulled myself together to take it again and passed it. I think you can do it too.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Exactly! You've got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You're welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I hear relaxing music and funny movies can do the trick.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, how are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there's anything going on?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it's happening and not have the opportunity to ask.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I've also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren't always a reflection of us or how we're performing.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I can imagine!<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available. That's what I did.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think reminding yourself that if there was a problem with your work they would be seeking YOU out, and not the other way around.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Restatement or Paraphrasing","Hopefully that mindset can help you stay positive until you have the chance to speak with them, instead of worrying about what you've done wrong. That anxiety feels like what is keeping you down?<|endoftext|>"
Information,I really hope that helps keep you afloat until you can get some real answers. Worrying about what-ifs is harder than just knowing what's goiong on!<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope you feel better soon and are able to clear it up!<|endoftext|>
Others,Have a good night!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,That's never good. I know how it can be to feel down. What's got you feeling that way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems like you're worried about your abilities as well as your team leader potentially being disappointed with your performance. Am I understanding that correctly?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That's lovely to hear. Have you tried discussing your doubts with your supervisor? There are times where I've felt overwhelmed, but maybe they could provide some additional guidance or someone to help assist you with the project.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is there an impending deadline for the project you're worried about meeting? Maybe you could contact them through email or another form of outreach.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I can understand how stressful that must be, with the business of the holiday season on top of a looming deadline. Is there anyone else you can potentially contact to discuss changing the deadline?<|endoftext|>"
Others,That sounds like a wonderful idea! That's what a teammate is there for after all.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sure they'd love to help. Is there anything else on your mind today?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?<|endoftext|>
Others,Awesome! Have a wonderful holiday season :).<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",All's well with me thank you :). Was there something you'd like to talk about?  I'm ready to listen.<|endoftext|>
Question,Oh?  Would like you to tell me what's happening?<|endoftext|>
Question,What sort of carrier?<|endoftext|>
Others,Or did you mean to say career.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Reflection of feelings","And what is it you are afraid may happen, can you explain more please? It is scary knowing our livelihood is at risk, I can understand that.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","I see, I have been in a lot of debt before and remember how stressful that was. What sort of work do you do?   Are you at risk of getting laid off?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others,Question","I see.  So the future is unknown, that can be scary for sure. You're welcome. Have you started looking for your next job?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Perhaps planning ahead will help you feel more of a sense of control, if that's possible to do.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Self-disclosure",Oh that's exciting!  What sort of business? It's very liberating being your own boss.  I used to have a small housecleaning business.  I loved being in charge of my own destiny.<|endoftext|>
Question,What sort of projects?   What field do you work in?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","I have a small business centre in my city that was very helpful when I was starting up.  I wonder if you have that in your city. What a great field to be in, so many opportunities.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome :)  Whereabouts do you live?  I'm in Canada.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh I'm glad, it was a pleasure speaking with you.   I wish you all the best in your venture.   I have faith you will get through this.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Well I can help you study if you'd like?<|endoftext|>
Question,What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Don't worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don't have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sure you will do just fine, you can do it!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, thats the spirit it works for me!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Of course anytime, have a goodnight!<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Yes, what is that?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Great anything else?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Okay  it has been nice chatting with you, feel free to end the chat now, goodbye.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm doing good today.  What brings you on here?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,ugh.  There's nothing worse than that.  Have you confronted the ex friend?<|endoftext|>
Question,oh wow.  that's not much of a friendship!  So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,that's an option but I hope it doesn't go that far again.  Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can understand that.  You don't want two people disrespecting you.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",I hear that!  What happened in court when you went? If you don't mind me asking.<|endoftext|>
Question,Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can.  Has she been in contact with you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Seems like a good idea.  Steer clear of her and don't associate with her!  Sounds like you're doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would if I were in your shoes.  You don't need two of the same person. Know what I mean?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,LOL if only everyone had that thought process.  Some people don't get it!<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings",Definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing! I know about the alone thing especially in these times.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Take those tools you have, steer clear of  her and do your own thing!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Most definitely.  I wish you the best.  If you every wanna chat again just stop on by!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Take care!<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am doing great, how about you?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Of course you can, tell me about it :).<|endoftext|>"
Question,Why so?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Hey I've been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it!<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Self-disclosure","Nothing special, just sit in my room in silence. Listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate. They get me relaxed and motivated for the day :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That's part of meditation! I too worry while meditating, but when i'm listening to the videos and following instructions all those worries go away :) If that doesn't help you, you can go out in nature to clear your mind off things. Being in the wild really motivates me to continue.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead.And the wild? that's whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature :).<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",Please do! You can try it with friends or alone. With friends can be a more fun experience while alone can be more spiritual or calming. I have tried both and both are amazing :).<|endoftext|>
Question,No problem. How can I help you tonight?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So just to make sure I understand, you are struggling with dealing with ending a long term relationship with your child's father.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","I am so sorry to hear that. My ex-fiance cheated on me and got pregnant with another man, so I know how rough this type of thing is. Have you been able to talk to him about it yet?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you talked to the kids about it? It will be important for them to understand what is going on and why.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",I think that would definitely help! What are some things you like to do?<|endoftext|>
Others,"You have to know that it wasn't your fault. He was the one who was unfaithful and there is nothing that you did to cause that. This was something I had to keep telling myself as I was trying to process everything. Sometimes it isn't easy, but you are your own biggest supporter. It wasn't your fault.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Not a problem at all! I know it's really hard right now, but I know you can make it through this!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Good, I am glad I was able to help you tonight!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Hello, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"What's wrong, do you feel like sharing?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I am so sorry to hear that. Sounds like your girlfriend and her grandmother could use some time away from her grandfather.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"His dementia is causing him to become upset? Your right he does need to be around family and needs love and support, and you are not doing wrong being on your girlfriend side.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is there any way you guys could get a nurse that deals with patients that have dementia to help him out?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others","What about getting a nurse, would make him lose his mind? It would be in his best interest to help him and others around him.<|endoftext|>"
Others,im so sorry im still here if you would like to talk.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure,Question",Hello. Hope you are doing fine. How was your day. Can i help you with anything? I've been feeling blessed today. Are you doing good today?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Reflection of feelings",Ohhh. Any specific reason or incident? I am really sorry to hear that.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance",Having many boyfriend is not a big deal. I believe that you are good. Things tends to happens for the goodness.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Information",Thanks for the compliments. People have worst time to bring up the bright times. I totally believe in it. Ohhh really. But women have a equal rights as men.<|endoftext|>
Information,Women's are succeeding in all the fields now a days.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question","I am glad that, I could able to help u. What kind of difficulties are u facing?<|endoftext|>"

Question,"I am good, thanks. Is there an issue I can provide you some support with?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So, to reiterate, you are suffering from anxiety due to school? Or is your anxiousness also caused by other life factors as well?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand what you are going through. It is as if you are being pulled in two directions, but are not sure which is the best option at the given moment. I think it is great that you wanted to go back to school, but if your heart is not in it, then it may not be what you should continue pursuing.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I can feel your worries when you speak about your anxiety, and I am hoping we can find a way to approach your feelings. Do you think there was a specific instance that is causing doubts within yourself or is it in your nature to self-doubt?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"This has also been a past struggle of mine, and I think it partially stems from the bar we set so high for ourselves. We obviously cannot reach the top right away, but have to work our way up. Often times, when facing an obstacle, such as a bad grade, we might retreat further down the path due to fear that it will keep happening. I know that I personally had a tendency to think of my family and friends who I feel are dependent on me or comparing myself with others when the only person we should think of in these instances is ourself. When making progress, tiny steps upward matter more than you think. But when we take a step backward, we cannot fall back down to the starting point by letting our doubts pile upon one another.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Of course, I am happy to help! I have noticed that letting yourself celebrate a good grade can be really helpful to feel that you are enough and making good progress. But when things do go south, because life certainly happens, we must stay in the present and live life like we usually would, with a drive that we are going to push harder against whatever we have to face next.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Exactly! I also suggest if you are having doubts, talk it out with someone like your partner or a close friend. They can often provide a pick me up you didn't even know you needed. More than anything, give yourself credit and relax. Take some time to just breathe and release the tension. I guarantee it will leave you feeling refreshed and fulfilled for the next tasks you have to face. I believe you can do this and I feel that you believe it too, which is amazing. As often as it is said, believing in yourself is truly the best foundation to achieve your goals.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You're welcome. It was great talking to you. Your future is bright, and I wish you all of the luck for the endeavors to get you there.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Enjoy the rest of your day!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I am sorry to hear that. I have insomnia and I know how horrible it is. Have you seen your doctor?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It might be worth it. They might be able to arrange you some counselling.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Nothing really lol. But there are things that can make it easier. There is over the counter medication available, for instance.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Oh that's a shame. Have you tried, for instance, getting some exercise an hour or two before bed?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like there might be other issues at work too ... anxiety?<|endoftext|>
Question,Gosh I am very sorry to hear that. Have you spoken to your cancer doctor about it?<|endoftext|>
Others,"There may be some relation between the two things, it's worth seeing.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Did the two things start at around the same time, do you remember?<|endoftext|>"
Information,Yes - there may well be some physical thing going on as well as the anxiety.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would definitely advise talking to her then. There might be something helpful she can recommend.<|endoftext|>
Question,Yes it definitely is. Are you at liberty to nap during the day if you feel really tired?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Try a nice milky drink just before you go to sleep too. Very soothing.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Watch one of your favourite movies before bed too .. that might relax you.<|endoftext|>
Question,You're most welcome - we have to talk for fifteen mins though so is there anything else I can advise you with?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have not but my sister practices it and apparently she finds it really helpful.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I think for over ten years. A Buddhist friend of hers taught her.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions","I would definitely recommend you trying it - at worst, it can't hurt. Anyway I hope I have been able to be of some help to you today and I wish you all the best for the future! (can you press quit after fifteen mins as I can't do it from this end).<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can you explain a little more what you mean by that?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like the trouble at home is making it hard for you to keep your mind on school. Is that right?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions,Providing Suggestions",I can understand why you would feel that way. You also sais there is a bully. Have you talked to anyone about this? Bringing this up to a teacher can help. Have you tried that?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure",I can tell just from this short chat how upset you are. I know when I was dealing with issues in school talking to my friends helped.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Question",It sounds like those people are not your friends then. Do you have any hobbies?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It might be a good idea to join a choir. That way you can meet people who love to sing just like you!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Sometimes it helps to bring up your feelings to your parents. Have you tried that?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can understand why you feel like that. I think it's worth bringing up.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It's understandable. Anyone would feel like that in your position. But I think you can do it and it will help!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe before you talk to them, take some time to write down what you are feeling. You could even give them a letter to read if that makes you more comfortable.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That sounds like you have a plan!<|endoftext|>
Others,You're welcome.<|endoftext|>
Others,No problem.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",I am well! How can I help you today?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",I am so sorry to hear that this has been going on. How recently did the divorce take place?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance","So you have children together and want to disconnect but that is a complicating factor? It must be so tough to be going through what you are going through now, I am so sorry.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you spoken to a professional? Is this something that you are able to do through your insurance or work?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I completely understand. I have been in situations at work that I couldn't resolve due to the exact same reasons.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Is there a way that you could seek help at work without anyone finding out?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Sometimes someone looking in from the outside can see things in a way that you might not be able to see since you are in the middle of the situation. I know that this has happened to  me.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Through work you may be able to speak to a professional counselor or therapist while just having a small co-pay.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Have a nice day as well, I hope that you can get your issues resolved.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday (+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I honestly didn't eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Of course, it is normal to feel upset. However, you should not blame yourself. No one is perfect.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I am glad it does :D! Anything else I can help you with today?<|endoftext|>

Question,I am sorry to hear that. Have you separated or can you just not be together at Christmas?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That is not good. But relationships can be reestablished if you talk. Have you considered seeing a third party to help you both talk this out?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I seem, so do I hear you saying that you feel that everyone is against you on this and that you feel powerless?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I am sorry that your parents are not being more supportive. I understand how hard it is when you have a break up and loved ones seem to support your ex!<|endoftext|>

Question,"Thank you :) I am sure that there is someone else out there for you too if you cannot reconcile with your ex. The question is, how much do you really want to? You might be better off without her.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is a good way to think! Never let something like this destroy your self esteem.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Yes, I am engaged now. I realise that my ex did me the biggest favour anyone ever could!<|endoftext|>"

Question,Do you think your mood is related to any current or recent events in your life?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Feeling down after an experience like that is certainly understandable, and I suspect that might be the main cause of your depression. Regarding losing your job, I wouldn't worry too much. New businesses are opening each day as the pandemic slowly goes away. You will have plenty of job opportunities. Similarly, you will also regain your confidence and social status as you interact with society more.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am feeling optimistic about this vaccine, you will see how it helps us all slowly get our lives back to how they were.<|endoftext|>"

"Reflection of feelings,Question","I see. And your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them. I am so sorry; I know that must be extremely stressful. Are you married right now? If so, does your spouse have a job?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I see. Do you mean that you are not on good terms with him?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","Yes, I can understand that. It's been cold and gloomy over here and my whole family has been in a bad mood. It seems like a little thing, but I find that taking Vitamin D supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Yep. Me too. I'm ready for all of this mess to be over.<|endoftext|>
Question,How important is it for you to be able to work right now? Does your husband make enough money to pay the bills and make sure you have somewhere to stay?<|endoftext|>

Question,I am sorry to hear that! What seems to be bothering you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can understand your anxiety.  I hate public speaking too. Is this a required class?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Self-disclosure",Only required in high school luckily in college I didn't have to do public speaking . What is your major ? I mean it sounds like this is a part of your major. Either way it is EXTREMELY stressful and I would  hate it.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I can tell this is challenging for you. May I suggest talking with your professor maybe you could pre record your speech and play it instead of actually doing it? Or maybe practicing with some friends or collegues and seeing if they would help you not be so nervous.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others",This is certainly a difficult time  and a unique one.  How about searching online for speech public speaking tips and or training type videos or even libraries some have online books/videos. I would be willing to do a zoom meeting and practice with you if you would like.<|endoftext|>
Others,I am sure there are some support groups out there you could search for maybe. Also prayer works if you believe in God as I do!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I understand better now sorry for the confusion. Have you spoken to your doctor for maybe temporary mild anxiety pills or something since you seem to have tried numerous things without much help.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others",Yes I completely agree! I am going be honest and not sure how to help you. I will pray for you but I don't know what else to help. i am happy to listen and be your friend.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Anxiety is a powerful thing and what may work for one person doesn't on another. I truly wish you the best . I would not want to be in your shoes . I honestly HATE public speaking. Yes it is and and most people say nothing left to do but pray and reality is that should be the first thing.  I have learned through many years and dont go to people houses or jam religion down throats but I am led lately to speak up in general conversation if it comes up.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Anyways,  it is time for me to go to bed. If we were able I would continue to talk to you and pray but as we can't I wish you all the best . Since you are in college you have your entire life ahead of you I hope.  Covid is temporary and this too shall pass. See you in heaven one day I hope . Goodnight and God bless.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I too believe it as well.  and you are right no one talks about it but it should be but it is easier for me with Covid since covid brings up death alot.  you are welcome and Keep safe and God did not give us a fearful mind but ... I don't remember all of it but you could google it .. something sound mind     and Satan will use fear to get us.<|endoftext|>
Information,tysm we all need prayers. sweet dreams my new friend.<|endoftext|>
Others,Also Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",I'm doing good! So how can help you? Is there anything bothering you today?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that :(. That is terrible.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you started looking for a new one? I know this is difficult but the best thing I would recommend is moving on.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Do you have a linkdin account?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",I would start by creating/updating that. That way you can find newer jobs.<|endoftext|>
Information,so linkedin gives quite a few suggested jobs given your profile.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","So an updated profile will show you jobs that you can apply that fit your skillset. I would go to the ""jobs"" section in the menu and see what jobs you like best. Its a bit vague but really just start looking and you will find something that fits!<|endoftext|>"
Information,Thats a good starting point too! I believe linkedin can give suggestions on resumes format as well too.<|endoftext|>

Others,Have a good day!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello though, how has life been treating you lately?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It has been a really weird year hasn't it? Don't worry, I think it's been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question",That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be! Are there any official routes that you can use to complain?<|endoftext|>
Others,That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint? It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it's a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I really can't wait for this year to be over! It's been so awful. Do you suppose anyone at all has had a good year?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions",Well yes fair point! Us poorer people are not doing very well though! Have you tried to talk with any of your coworkers about this? I would suggest that it might help.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I really think you should. You have a legitimate grievance and being able to discuss it with people who understand might help a lot.<|endoftext|>
Others,I feel that people have the right to know what is being done and will be happy you told them.<|endoftext|>
Others,You are very welcome. I hope I have been able to be of some help to you and you will continue to talk to other people about it.<|endoftext|>

Question,How long have you been in a relationship with your man?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Sure, I understand.<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance","Yes, the workplace is not like home life. Yes, trust matters.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work.  If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis?<|endoftext|>"

I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,How do you all generally communicate? Through text?<|endoftext|>
Question,Which do you and your man like to communicate?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I would be subtle about that tactic. If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option.  Have you met any of his class mates?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct?<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Reflection of feelings",Where do you work? Have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating? Seen the customer before? Was it a man or woman who dropped the shocking news? I feel that the customer may have a case of mistaken identity indeed.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Sounds like drunk slander talk.  I would let things go for awhile and follow up later.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am really sorry to hear that.<|endoftext|>
Question,What is making things so hard?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I definitely understand that. I also have been having a hard time in quarantine.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Do you have people you can talk to digitally? Friends, family?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question",I get that. It can be really frustrating when you feel alone and like you've got no one to talk to. Especially when 2020 seems to be dumping things on you. What have you been doing to pass the time? Is there anything that you've found that makes you feel better?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That can be handy!<|endoftext|>
"Question,Self-disclosure","Is that something you can do with regularity? Getting out and walking? I know that I've had good luck battling my depression by just finding ways to not be at home. Hiking, going for walks, going for drives...<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Good! It's hard to start, but it's a good way to start. How far do you plan on going?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question",That will be good. Make sure you can take some time and really appreciate not being in the house. Is there any music or podcats you can listen to while out?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I am glad. Practicing mindfulness can really help, and help put things in perspective. Often times we build things up to be even worse than they already are. Being able to be grateful for what's around can help, without diminishing the issues that you are facing.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Remembering that it's okay to be sad and depressed, as much as it sucks, can be helpful in reframing. It's a rough time for everyone and you definitely are not alone.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I absolutely get it. I work from home right now so it's just me all day. Sometimes, I literally only talk to my cats. I am a crazy cat lady.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question",I had a whole cry and freak out moment when part 2 of quarantine hit recently. I wholeheartedly understand. Do you have any pets?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Smart cats are the best. They know when you need cuddles, which it sounds like you do! Also means you aren't alone. ;) Cat needs ya! As much as they don't want to admit it.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If you are healthy/feel comfortable with going out, you could consider volunteering at an animal shelter. You'd get to interact with some folks, some animals, and add something to the resume. I don't know if you are likely to get hours back at work or what you do, but that could be fun!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I believe it needs to be a minimum of 20 minutes and we are at 17 right now. For the max that is, lol.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"West Coast of all things! WA st, so lots of hiking for me. It's been helping so much.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Oh hey! So all of your family is here then. What prompted the move?<|endoftext|>

Question,have you spoken to any friends or family members about how you are feeling?<|endoftext|>
Question,has anything changed recently in your life that you think might be contributing to this feeling of depression that you are having?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I'm sorry to hear that. my friend lost his job about 6 months ago and he was also feeling a similar way. I think this is to be expected when you have a sudden change in circumstances however this by no means undermines the seriousness of the issue.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,that's great to hear. it sounds like if you address the issue that has made you depressed in the first place this will go a long way to making you feel better about things.<|endoftext|>
Information,I haven't had this issue personally but a friend has. It is true that your job also forms an important part of your identity and when your job situation change is it have a big impact on your personal life and mental well-being.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",it took him awhile but once you found new job that he enjoyed the depression went away. there are some support groups out there for depression so if you need to talk to someone about that would likely help too.<|endoftext|>
Others,You are very welcome. Thanks for reaching out.<|endoftext|>
Others,Hello! I think you are carrying on from another conversation. This is a different one.<|endoftext|>
Others,I can't see the topic area of yours.<|endoftext|>
Others,What happened? Who is jealous of what.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"She may have been jealous but also may secretly want one, and she shouldn't stay with a guy she doesn't like. Maybe she thinks you are more ahead than her in life or something.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Maybe it was one of those things she always wanted but never had the chance like you said. And maybe it just got to her at one point. It's not your fault though, with time she will ease out.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe she would be too scared since she already blocked you, you should give her time to ease up and then start a conversation and hopefully she will be good again.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yeah, it will but she will come back eventually.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That is your friend so you will miss her eventually and just give her time ;).<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",breakups can be really hard! can i ask why she dumped you?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Restatement or Paraphrasing",sounds like you are pretty depressed. that is understandable though. if she was cheating she wanst that good of a girl friend. if she said you were not compatible then it sounds to me like she has someone else.<|endoftext|>

"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","it can be hard letting people in so they can get to know you. fear and worry is natural, expecially after being hurt. can you think of anything you could do differnt in a new relationship if you entered one?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","personally, i think dating right now is hard with all the covid crap. its hard to go on dates and do things other than sit in front of a tv. it makes things difficult. do you trust your mom?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Restatement or Paraphrasing",lol  i was adopted. i don't trust my mom. either of them... lol that was a horrible example. what i was getting at awas maybe changing your sentance to i dont trust many women.<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,"you are hurt because she broke up with you... that will make you stronger and be more attentive next time. and if everyone was born and met thier solemate it would be odd. life is about ups and downs. by the time you find mrs right, all these idiots that were not good for you will help turn you into the perfect person for the one that wont break your heart.<|endoftext|>"

"Providing Suggestions,Information",That can certainly be difficult to talk about. But maybe you can build stronger relationships with them. Friendships can change overtime and sometimes people who don't value the friendship can find themselves without friends.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe you don't have to say goodbye. Maybe you can just ignore them and see if any of them reach out to you. You shouldn't have to feel bad in a friendship. Friends are supposed to support each other. If you aren't feeling support, maybe it's time to make new friends.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I think that's a great plan!<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"oh no, do you think you could do something to earn some extra credit?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I was the opposite in school i could pass a test no problem but i was not good on writing papers.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is your overall grade pretty high without the grade from this current paper?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Maybe you could talk to your teacher and find out what they feel you could have done differently to get a better grade.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"since it is only your first grade of the semester try not to let it get you to down, i am sure you can pull you average back up.<|endoftext|>"

"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I've been having a hard time too and I've absolutely noticed that I've become short and impatient with people lately. I have been trying to be mindful but it's hard. I find going for walks and getting slight exercise helps. I'm also pretty introverted and at first i enjoyed the shutdowns but as time drags on it's gotten difficult. Have you found ways to be physically active?<|endoftext|>
Question,Does that help at all?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So it sounds like you are missing a lot of the social aspects of day to day stuff?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I've definitely noticed that for myself, even though I normally prefer my space and solitude. Have you tried calling, texting, or even video chatting with them?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",I seem to feel better after communicating with friends but I also get a little overwhelmed with video chats. I feel like Im always on my computer now so I'm working at trying to actively seeing my friends even if it means distancing or whatever. Do you have a park or a hiking trail or something that you could meet them at? That way you stay outside and can distance as necessary.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you have friends that could go with you to the dog park? Do you think you'd feel comfortable physically being around other people?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"im sure seeing someone in person will help even if it's for a few minutes. Once you figure out how to hang out with someone that makes you both comfortable, the next times will be that much easier.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,No problem! I'm glad I could help or at least try to help.<|endoftext|>
Others,Awe thanks! I appreciate you too.<|endoftext|>
Question,Can you tell me more about your feelings?<|endoftext|>
Question,When did these feelings come about.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,it seems like this could be overwhelming to you and trying to figure out the right path to go forward.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I can relate to you in this situation 100% and if it wasnt for me stepping out on faith and opening my own practice, I wouldnt be here now.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights. Have you tried to look into things like that yourself?<|endoftext|>"
Question,That I do understand as well. This pandemic has made it hard for everyone. Are you a parent with any little ones by chance?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"So here is some information that I have in my files to help others during this time. There is self-help.org that is labeled as being a self help during these times. There is also websites that i used like offerup and PoshMark where I was able to start selling some of my belongings to constantly bring in funds. Also try to google ""How to become a first time business owner"" and see if any of this information helps you and your family.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I know that it can be hard and frustrating during this time, but you have to remain focused for your family and stay strong because I am sure they look up to you.With myself I did have to go to a lot of friends and family, but my faith and my blessings came from God. Looking to him to help with your problems and actually listening to his words would really alleviate some of the stress that is so draining.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Just keep your eyes on the prize because this means that HE has something bigger in store for you!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You are very welcome and I am glad that I was able to be here for you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I am sorry that you feel that way.  Have you tried asking them why they don't express care towards you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,If they don't see on the same level as you do then maybe it is time to seek new friends.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions",It takes time to build friendships and relations.  The best way to establish the connection is to find individuals who share similar interests with you. There is no harm to approach people and introduce yourself.  Find some common interests by asking a few questions.  If you like the individuals' personality and if they seem genuine then you can seek a stronger connection.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Anime you say?  I love anime as well!  For me, I use the interest of anime to seek groups who are interested in anime as well.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,There are plenty of individuals who shares common interests like you do!  Do not let other's opinions hinder your judgement.<|endoftext|>

"Providing Suggestions,Information",I highly recommend for you to join an anime club or group.  These places are great for you to establish a strong connection with others through shared interests. Anime clubs are found in schools and on social media!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,They have one?  That is fantastic! Don't be afraid!  They will love to take you in as a member don't worry.<|endoftext|>

Question,May I ask the reason why you are mad?<|endoftext|>
Others,were their actions accidental or intentional?<|endoftext|>
Question,Did you say anything offensive?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I see.  If that is the case, create a personal meeting with you and your friends (the ones who banned you).<|endoftext|>"
Question,"just to clarify, are these online friends?  Have you met them in person?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"and now for that one friend, does he know the other friends personally?<|endoftext|>"
Others,I'm sorry to hear that.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"The best advice I can give you is to try to get your friends together on a private group call.  Then tell them that what they've heard was a complete misunderstanding.  And tell them to unban you from playstation. However, if they do not respect your response, then they can't really be relied on as your friends.  They don't come to respect you so it is best for you to move on.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Nobody should demoralize another person and that is what your ""online friends"" are taking advantage of.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Also send a report to Sony about the ban.  I believe with the proof, they can appeal the ban for you!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,In that case just keep reporting them.<|endoftext|>
Others,Ah I see!  Don't get your nephew banned!<|endoftext|>
Question,how close are you to your nephew?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"If he's relying on your payments for the content, then I suggest for you to stop the payments until he learns his lesson.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,He clearly does not respect you so you need to set up some discipline and ground rules.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Honestly, he's your nephew.  So the fault lies on his parents.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,But I really do hope you get your account back.  I'm sorry of how your online friends have treated you and your girlfriend.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,And I hope my advice/suggestions have been helpful!<|endoftext|>

Question,"Hello, how are you at the moment? My name is Jo.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am not so bad. Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about today?<|endoftext|>
Others,"I am sorry to hear that. What precipitated that, had you been having problems for a while?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Ah, so you feel as though your mother could and should have helped and you were put into an impossible position you were not prepared for?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I can sympathise with you having siblings with extreme mental health problems - I have been there too and I know how difficult it is.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Mentally ill people can unfortunately sometimes be manipulative, though they do not mean it. Have you had any contact with her since?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That sounds very toxic. Is it possible to persuade her to seek medical help? I realise she might be reluctant to.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it? I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus. Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your  tone of voice. Please remember that you can't fix everything in the world.<|endoftext|>
Information,Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems. It might have been best if you did not press her too hard to do that though I know you did not realise.<|endoftext|>
Question,Does she suffer from depression also? That might account for her trying to shut herself away.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I understand that it can be very difficult to make people take medication if they refuse to recognise that they have a problem.<|endoftext|>
Others,Unfortunately that is not likely to be possible. All you can do is be kind to yourself and know that you really did try to help her.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope that I have been able to help a little. I really appreciate that you felt that you could open up to me.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",You're welcome. Have a lovely festive season! I feel that all will be better in the coming year. You need to press quit from your end and take the survey :).<|endoftext|>
Others,"Hi there! I'm great, what about you? How can I help today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm so sorry to hear that :( Do you have any idea why?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That's tough... so you're saying that you grew apart a little? Or do you think it was more one-sided?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I completely understand, and I don't think you should beat yourself up over it!<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Restatement or Paraphrasing","Exactly, and remember everyone is different, perhaps you just weren't her right one, and that can go both ways. Do you want to improve for her? or for yourself do you think?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's a great line of thought, its good that you're able to identify that yourself.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","I suggest that you stay exactly the way that you are. I feel like you'd be happier that way and also more likely to find someone who shares the same values as you. If you change who you are, it sort of means that your ex still has a hold on you, you know?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I guess that depends on you, would you rather compromise for a relationship or find one who'll really last and not have to change?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's true, building on that, you could also say that what your ex found to be the problem is not the be-all end-all. What your ex disliked could be what 10000 other girls love in a guy.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Wow, you put that really nicely!<|endoftext|>"
Others,It was no problem! Thank you for sharing and talking it out!<|endoftext|>

"Question,Others",You are making good steps to rethink the situations. Is there anything else contributing to the heat rack you still feel? Heartbreak.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,That is difficult. I understand how it feels to be lonely. Something I’ve done when I’ve felt that way was to learn to fall in love with myself. I like to do self care and make time for things I might not have time for if I were in a relationship.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,So you feel that life was more simple when you were still in high school?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think that it is quite usual to feel a bit disorientated when transitioning from school to college. It is strange to feel like an adult all of a sudden.<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings,Question","It is hard to get passed someone's words, especially after spending so much time with them. How about start with a fish. I have a betta and he is really easy to take care of. But I have the responsibility of attending to his needs. If you can take care of a fish, you surely can take care of a cat or dog! I apologize if my typing is slow. I think maybe a small vacation would help. Or doing something you really enjoy. Is there anything you can think of?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I agree. Are you a social person by any chance? By saying that I mean you can still go do those activities, but you can maybe meet people there and ask if you can join their group. That's great in a way because you meet new people and there are no attachments after you leave. It's like a fun, crazy experience :).<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"Sometimes it's hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were'nt for tough times.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies?<|endoftext|>"

Self-disclosure,you will be okay no matter what.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,the only way the situation will be solved is by communicating and expressing your feelings.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So what I hear you saying is that you are engaged and your fiance will not speak to you.  However, you are  unsure as to why she is behaving this way?  Is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Unfortunately sometimes people do just grow apart.  There may not be any concrete reason behind it.  It appears that, for whatever reason, she does not want to talk.  I can understand how this would be upsetting and that it would be hard to obtain closure and move on.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried emailing her?  Perhaps she would be willing to explain in a more neutral environment?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","It might be an option.  Maybe just lay out how you feel in it, and just ask her for an explanation perhaps.  It might be good to let her know that ""I understand it's over, but could you help me understand why so that I can close this chapter"" - perhaps she would respond to something like that.  If she doesn't, then you are going to have to make some hard decisions and try to process this. It's a very hard position to be in, but life is too beautiful to be miserable, and I know you would rather be happy.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You are going to have to lay it all on the line with her, but be prepared for her to not respond in the way that you want.  Sometimes we do the best we can, and it still doesn't change the situation.

Question,Did her being depressed have an effect on you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"of course you were sympathetic towards her pain, that is totally understandable.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That sounds great, that you were able to help her out in that way.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"So as she became better, you started to feel worse?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"That's interesting, so you feel that you were together so long as you could help her, but then you lost interest in her?<|endoftext|>"
Question,or did she reject you once she felt better?<|endoftext|>
Question,Has that happened to you in other relationships?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you have not had any successful relationships since then?  Do you think that is why you feel depressed?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"So that is good, that even after the end of your romantic relationship you were still able to maintain a friendship.<|endoftext|>"

"Providing Suggestions,Others",That is really good to hear.  Hopefully you can continue to do that and help yourself by helping others. Maybe we can talk more at a later time.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can understand why you would feel this way. Maybe you should try to take a step back and reassess the situation.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It may be a good time to go over your resume, making sure to fine tune all of your achievements and qualifications. This may help ease some of your worries and fears.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems that you are mixed up in the decision to put in extra funds in a professional resume polish or use your time and energy instead of actual financial means. Is that right?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Perhaps you should speak to a trusted mentor or a closed loved one and seek their opinion. Often, we need someone outside of the actual situation that can give us great advice.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand we can all feel anxious during an interview, but remember what great qualities you can bring to the table and believe in yourself!<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Also, there are many online resources that are great at finding available jobs and require your time and effort, but not any money invested. This might be a good tool as well!<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I hope so. I've also been in a similar situation so I can completely understand your feelings. Keep in mind there are also resume sites that are free to use, as I know you are concerned about the financial part in that area.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Can I help with anything else?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Your feelings are completely valid and I wish you the best. You got this!<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"ok, i did understand..<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"it doesn't matter what others say about us, do your duty properly ok.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,don't think about that..<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"share your comments it is their choice whether to accept or disagree, but you don't change anything.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Hmm good.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Hmm all the best.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello how are you today?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about it?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Its great that you decided to go back to school. Are you having trouble selecting a college or something like that?<|endoftext|>
Information,I understand your concern  given the current pandemic situation. But I have heard some colleges are offering online courses until this pandemic is over. Maybe you can explore in that direction to ease your worries.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I definitely resonate with the way you feel about online learning. Although difficult it is also important to stay indoors to keep yourself safe. Is there anything that will motivate you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Maybe you can check with the college if they would consider offering classes over zoom as this is the most preferred mode of instruction.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Sounds like a plan and am happy to see that you are sure about what you want.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I too wish everything goes back to the way it was and it will one day. We have to adjust to a slightly new way of living and this would happen if each one of us do our part to break the chain and flatten the curve.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You can do it, as you said you are almost there. Once you do it you will be very proud of yourself. Believe me this is just a temporary setback and you are doing a great job.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am glad I could make you feel better. Is there anything else I can do today for you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am doing well, I also get really anxious about my classes. They can be really stressful.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I agree, there is so much going on that it is hard to stay focused while trying to make sense of all this.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :).<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class? Just not enough time or just situations you cannot control. Trust me I understand myself, I have been in college 2.5 years myself. and it took about 1.5 years to get to where I was comfortable with my schedule and personal time.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am really glad I can help, I think part of me was talking to myself as well when giving advice since I have gotten alot lazier these days. I hope you have a great day and hang in there and stay focused and you will do great!!!!!<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hello, how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm doing alright, thank you. I'm here for you if you'd like to tell me about anything going on in your life.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,A lot of people are in a tight bind right now with money... myself included.  Do you need money to buy presents?<|endoftext|>
Question,Where do you want to take your friends and girlfriend?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That is very sweet of you. Is there a more affordable place you can take them? That is very sweet of you. Is there a more affordable place you can take them?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","It doesn't feel good to not have enough money to do the things you could normally do, but I'm sure that the people around you will be understanding. Do you live somewhere hot or cold? Maybe you can plan something based on enjoying nature.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It seems like you feel like you will be a disappointment to your loved ones if you can't provide a special holiday celebration for them, is that right?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You might be surprised how your loved ones will react though. I think a lot of times it is more about the effort & time that you put into planning something. People will see the effort that you make, you seem very sweet.<|endoftext|>"
Question,How big of a party will it be?<|endoftext|>
Question,"That seems like a lot of money to get quick, what part of the party will cost the most money?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Maybe this year you could have a party in your home? And cook a lot of delicious food & ask people to bring their own drinks.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It sounds like you have to decide whether the party is important enough to borrow money for. Its been such a  hard year for everyone, that a party could be good to raise everyone's spirits. However it could make your financial situation worse.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Don't be afraid to ask the people you love for help! Bye.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello! how are you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,Why is that?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Oh I see.  Your colleagues talking about you has you feeling down today.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I understand why that would be so.  I have had a similar situation happen to me before.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I totally understand why you are sad.  It's very hurtful when someone talks bad about you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well I convinced myself that their opinions did not matter. Also, I confronted a few of them alone to find out why they were talking about me. Another thing that you can do if nothing else works is to move to another department or even another job. But before you do that try and find out what the problem is exactly.  Maybe it is not as bad as you think.<|endoftext|>"
Information,In situations like this people tend to feel more powerful when they withhold information.  They are more than likely very immature and insecure.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Self-disclosure","That is a perfect example of immaturity.  When people act like this, the person they are ostracizing makes them feel threatened in some way so they treat them badly in order to regain control and security. I had someone that felt very insecure because of me talk badly about me to our mutual friends and even family.  What I ended up doing was to completely block the person out of my life and go on living and being me. I showed the people that that person was a jealous, insecure liar simply by being myself.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hi can I help you today?  I.am here to listen. Do you have anything happen recently that has you feeling badly?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh I am really sorry to hear that, DId you have the same job for a long time? That sounds very difficult to deal with.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Thank you for sharing and reaching out for support today.

You're a dedicated employee.<|endoftext|>
Others,That is really unfair and hard to deal with are you close to any famliy?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Do you have any close friends to talk to about any new job prospects?<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,I am sorry that you're feeling stress. Have you ever used writing as a tool to relax?<|endoftext|>
Information,"Oh, wow then you do have a lot of contacts and some support or at least understanding. Music is a great way to relax and that id very positive in your life and current situation.<|endoftext|>"
Information,That is a great outlook. Thank you for sharing today.<|endoftext|>
Information,Thank you for reaching out today amd letting me listen.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would suggest getting a pet if you are up for it. They can be support animals.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I can understand that feeling. I think maybe fish would be a distraction you may like to.<|endoftext|>
Information,I understand and believe you have a great focus on a career. I am proud of you and your focus ability.<|endoftext|>
Information,You're welcome I can be available to listen or bounce ideas of off as much as you need.<|endoftext|>
Information,That is the goal and what we strive for. You are welcome.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Bye, have a wonderful day.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I see you are feeling sad and lonely, is there anything going on right now to enhance those feelings?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"There is a lot going on right now, but i see you said its making it worse. What may be the root cause?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I understand having it seem like there is no one to talk to. I am here and there are others. I believe you can find an outlet to share.<|endoftext|>
Information,"I would first start to try and feel connected. There are many online forums, that perhaps you can join in on things that interest you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Local, and safe, meetings are a good start as well. Have you tried looking for any online local spots? Or in a local news paper? Its great you are coming up with ideas already.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Those are more for a quicker deeper connection. I would try to cast a broad net. Maybe with Meetup or Nextdoor.<|endoftext|>
Information,It is an app to get you connected to your local community and neighbors.<|endoftext|>
Information,I believe it does have subsections but it is more of a general hang out for neighbors to keep up with each other.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I do love books. They are a great way to get connected with yourself and enhance your creative side! I bet you could find a local book club on one of those apps.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Rachel, and no need to thank me! Being able to help is the greatest reward!<|endoftext|>"
Others,I wish you the best as well!<|endoftext|>

"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","Any other questions for me? I know it is hard at times, but be strong.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What seems to be bothering you?<|endoftext|>
Question,When was the last time you were employed?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Coronavirus has impacted lives of many hard-working people. Are you eligible to receive help from the government?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I understand how being umemployed at this time could be very stressful.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I would apply anywhere that is hiring. You'd be surprised with the feedback you get. Being in the house will not help. If you've applied everywhere online, why not take a walk some where near to apply to small businesses that may not have applications online. Would that be an option for you?<|endoftext|>"
Others,It would also help you get out of the house and have something positive to think about!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Most people would agree! You have to be able to get out of the house and be social in order to be truly happy and then you will enjoy your time at home once again.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"As for your pending bills, you can always try to see what type of assistance you can be provided by the company billing you. There may also be assistance by your local government for electric bills, water bills, and so forth.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Collection companies will usually work with you so you can make payments instead of paying one lump sum. After the payment plan has been sent or you've paid you're full amount it will even come off of your credit.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know it is harder to see the brighter side of things when depression is involved but it will get better! You will find a job and be the best you can be!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello. How are you doing these days?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I totally understand it. I felt lonely too by staying home all the time. But I found we can borrow books online. A good book can really help.<|endoftext|>
Information,Both will help. But ebooks are easier to get and you don't need to contact anyone and anything outside your home.<|endoftext|>
Information,I like biographies. Stories of real people are inspiring.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is a great idea! Dog is human's best friend. I would love to have a dog myself.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I don't have a dog, because I like to travel. However I have taken care of other people's dogs a lot when I am home.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,We are in similar situation. These days I only go out for grocery shopping.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yeah, economy cannot do well if this situation drags on. Hope the vaccine will soon be approved and life can be back to normal.<|endoftext|>"

"Others,Question",I can most certianly help! What has happened?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Oh honey I am so sorry to hear that! Hearing that he was with another girl can be very painful.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You deserve so much better than someone who is willing to lie to you & go behind your back.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You are a strong, beautiful, intelligent woman dont let his unfaithfulness be a reflection of you. This indescrestion only shows his shallow personality to which you deserve better!<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Yes i have had the misfortune of experiencing a cheating boyfriend. I left him and to my surprise i met my amazing husband soon after dumping my cheating ex.<|endoftext|>

Question,Hello. I am doing well. How are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",It sounds like you are very stressed out by the situation. Have you explained to her that her excessive drinking is causing problems?<|endoftext|>
Question,Why is she turning everything around on you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That sounds horrible especially that she is dragging your daughter into it.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,I can feel how anxious you are.<|endoftext|>

Others,Bye.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear that. What is causing you these feelings?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds like a difficult situation. Have you tried any personal exercises to help you cope with the situation until you find a resolution?<|endoftext|>
Question,That's certainly a difficult situation. Is there no resolution possible with the father of your grandson? I want to make sure that th.e cause of the depression has properly been addressed by you or someone else.<|endoftext|>
Question,"I think it's great that you have such care and concern for your grandson. That shows how incredible you are and on behalf of your grandson, I think you are doing a tremendous job. I think you should continue to support him however you can, but it's also important to take care of yourself. Do you have time available for additional self care, or are there any new exercises you can try to try to take care of yourself?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That sounds like a great start. Self care is vitally important in this difficulty time with COVID and the pandemic. I recommend any little bit of time that you can contribute to yourself, this includes reading, relaxing, meditating, exercise, or just resting. Anything that can help you repair so you are better prepared to help your grandson.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Providing Suggestions","Do you think the anger you are feeling is directly a result of the situation? Do you feel the anger is manifested from somewhere else? I think it is important to get to the underlying source of the anger and take care of that first and foremost. That's concerning, but very understandable. Are you able to financially seek additional help? Sometimes it's just what you need, as hard or embarrassing as that may seem. No one needs to know what you seek, but it is important not to disregard additional help, be it mental health, physical therapy, or just general prevention and detection from a PCP.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think that's a normal way to feel and a frustrating part of growing older. I think focusing on positives and things you enjoy will help keep your mind away from thinking about ""what used to be"" or ""what once was"" - finding passions and joys in new things could help revitalize you.Can I help you find new hobbies or passions? I think exercise bands are a great way to keep your limbs loose and nimble. They are affordable and available on Amazon. I have some and I think they're great. YouTube can help with exercises.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Totally understandable. I'm a little younger and even I am sick of sub 50F weather, so that's not age holding you back! I think it's important to maintain positivity and find any outlet that keeps that going for you.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today, even if it's something as simple as providing suggestions for new things to try?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Meditation has worked wonder for my best friend. The app Headspace is fantastic. I'd also recommend podcasts, using either and app or your computer, and find a series on a topic that you enjoy, weather it's mindfulness, or self-care. There are plenty to choose from and you can go at your own pace.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"You're welcome. I hope you find peace within and happiness again. Your grandson will improve with time, it's inevitable! But stay positive, stay focused, and be sure to not take anything out on him as he relies on you and your input. Have a wonderful day!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hi! how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you have low energy. What makes you feel down?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I can understand parental pressure. They want to see you to be a successful person. Sometime it is overwhelming. you should talk to them that you are doing your best.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It must be tough time for you. show your work report to your parents and try to tell them all the people are born with different potential.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Most of the parents behave like this when it is regarding their kids future. When I was in school same thing happened with mw. They know us very well I realized now.  Try to talk to them everyday for a while. It might work.<|endoftext|>
Others,Hope you are feeling bit relaxed now.<|endoftext|>
Others,I am glad that I am able to make you happy.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,sure! You don't have to worry about that. that should be their problem. just ignore them or don't give attention. They will stop doing it for sure.<|endoftext|>

Question,I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything in particular you wanted to discuss?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"That definitely sounds like a rough situation and I'm sorry to hear about it, though I'm glad you decided to reach out.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That's what I'm here for. I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally? It also sounds like keeping in touch with your cousin isn't helping in any way, so maybe we can talk about how to handle that? I am entirely at your disposal.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information","I see, it certainly doesn't help that it's difficult to keep in touch with your provider. I have a website that contains a list of support groups provided by NAMI. Would you be interested in it? Many of the support groups are offered multiple times a week online, so you wouldn't even have to leave your home.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Of course, here's the link: namimainlinepa.org/online-and-telephone-support-groups/.<|endoftext|>"

Question,why do yo think you are having a hard time making fiendships?<|endoftext|>
Question,are you in support or recovery yourself?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"i know that can be a very tough situation, my father and brother are both addicts. it helps to have a good support structure around you to stay in your sobriety.. do you go to any group meetings or support groups?<|endoftext|>"

If you word it right, they will believe that you really care about your job (I can tell that you really do). I am sure they don't want to lose you.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","You are right. I feel your anxiety in this. Competition is high in all industries right now it seems. Maybe sign up with those employment sites online. Indeed, ZipRecuiter, etc...it can't hurt to see what other options are out there.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Wow that sounds super interesting. You have nothing to lose going to upper management though with your concern. I have been in management and when employees came to me with concerns and showed me how much they cared about their job to take the time to bring me their input.<|endoftext|>

Question,How long have you lived with depression?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Do you have problem with sleeping, eating or daily activity because of it?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance","It seems like you're confused as what to expect and react as I understand. Depression is tough to deal with. We can try to find a way to temporarily suppress it but ultimately, we need to find the cause and treat.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","I cry, crying actually helps since it relieves the pain youhave to go through. After you cry, your body tends to be exhausted and you can just sleep without thinking. However, the best way to cope with death and depression in general is stay outdoor, be closed tothe nature.<|endoftext|>"

Others,Bye.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello! How can I help you today?<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"I know that I told you to try to fit school time into your schedule, but the same goes with leisure time for yourself. Find an activity that you enjoy and try to dedicate at least an hour a day to it, be it exercising, playing videogames, reading a book.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority. Try to maximize your efficiency so you can do your work while having more time for other activities.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Did you speak to your friend about it?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","I have been in a similar situation with a friend and her husband; when he was exhibiiing bad behavior, she did not want to see it in him. I agree that she should value you your friendship more than someone she just met.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you are worried about your friend putting her trust into this guy.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I think if you talk to her again and tell her you are looking out for her best interests it may help open a conversation. If you do end up calling the cops, at least you will have tried to speak with her first.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Knowing your friend, do you really think she would do that?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","It sounds like you really care about your friend, and want the best for her. She may not realize this but you are doing the right thing.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"Thank you. Please use ""Finish and Quit"" to end the discussion.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Sure.. do you have any other pet?<|endoftext|>

"Reflection of feelings,Question","Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can't keep them neat. is your hair short or long?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought....you say you always look like a mess...is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,have you asked a friend for an honest opinion?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance.<|endoftext|>

Others,yay!  a haircut!!!  Congrats.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure",one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps? oh thankyou....had my shot yesterday....now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire (May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you googled images for short curly hairstyles?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance",Second shot congrats!!   Very exciting. Pinterest is a great source for hairstyles as I recall...there are boards and boards of them.  Good idea!<|endoftext|>
Others,which vaccine did  you get?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","I'm sorry to hear that, that is a rough situation to be dealing with. What's very important for you to know is that you cannot control another person's actions.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It's difficult for those close to an alcoholic to watch them destroy themselves. I will tell you that you can only take care of yourself.  And you can only be honest with them about how their actions affect you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You may need to take some time away from the friendship then.  To show him you are serious that you can't tolerate the behavior any longer.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That's understandable.  But if you continue trying the same solution over and over again, but are getting the same result...<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","In that case, you should be sure to shore up your defenses and be prepared, because it will be hard.  You are a good friend, but don't lose yourself to save him. Consulting some literature for friends and family of alcoholics may be useful as well, Al-Anon or something like that.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","You should be able to find online Al-Anon groups, too. I'm sure he does.  Don't forget that you do as well.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,It looks like they do offer online chats: http://al-anon.org/al-anon-meetings.<|endoftext|>
Others,"So much like this chat here, you wouldn't even have to give your real name, nothing identifying, just support for you.  Supporting an alcohol is exhausting, and you will need resources. And a place to vent.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Try not to demonize your own frustrations, be easy on yourself when it comes to feeling upset with the situation, and continue trying to let him know that he hurts you when he behaves like that.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","Absolutely :-)  I hope that it helps.  You sound like a very kind-hearted person, and I understand that your situation is complex. Just remember that you are as deserving of relief as he is.  They always tell you on an airplane to put on your oxygen mask first, then others in your group.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I'm happy to hear that, I wish you luck and take care of yourself.<|endoftext|>"
Question,can you tell me more about that?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",It sounds like you're physically attracted to Doug and had a one-time encounter with him. Is that right? can you tell me more about how you're feeling now?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sure it's frustrating that you're not getting the emotional support you need. It's great that you are reaching out to communicate with someone.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that. I've known lots of people who've ended up in relationships with married people. Just reaching out to talk with someone else is a great first step.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Sometimes, a good first step is to reach out to friends who can help you fill your time and avoid interactions with him. And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question","I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that Doug is being honest with you or with his wife. You mentioned that Doug can't provide the emotional support that you need. Do you think he's being fully honest with you about his relationship with his wife?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You're absolutely right. It sounds like Doug is the problem. He's cheating on his wife, and he's not giving you the emotional support you need.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"With the holidays coming up, maybe you could avoid him for an extended stretch and really do something about what it is you are looking for in a partner.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I wouldn't say that Doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that Doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship. How did you spend your time before you met Doug? Perhaps you could reconnect with other friends or find a hobby to fill your time.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I absolutely have had my heart broken, yes. And I've spent some holidays alone. I can understand your pain.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","It would be great to be able to give you an easy and pain-free solution, but I don't know that that is possible when it comes to matters of the heart. If you truly love Doug and want to be with him, you should tell him that and see how he responds. You mentioned, though, that he can't give you the emotional support you need. If you truly believe, in your heart of hearts, that Doug can't be your everything, then you already have the answer: He is not ""the one."" He's the one right now. And you shouldn't have to settle for that. You sound like a strong and capable woman who should be loved and respected for everything she is.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I regret my assumption. I hope you can find happiness!<|endoftext|>
Question,Glad to know that you are doing well. How may I assist you today ?<|endoftext|>

Others,Just stick to the plan. Spend more time together. Cook dinner for her. Make a strong bond and my best wishes are there for you .<|endoftext|>

How has your friendship been in the midst of everything these days?<|endoftext|>"

Others,"You're welcome! Thank you for being a wonderful friend, the world needs more people like you. Take care of yourself :).<|endoftext|>"

Others,are you saying that the woman you are marrying is not the woman who is pregnant?<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings",What do you think you will do. Tell your finance or not tell your fiance. she will be your wife. this is important for her to know?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Every man would be scared in your situation. This is a fact. But some with tell and some will not.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I cannot tell you what to do. I can tell you that you will make vows to your wife, to be honest and faithful. You have to decide if you want to lie or tell the truth. neither is wrong or right.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"Awhile. it started to feel a little bit better after I kept telling myself it was about him and not about me, then I started feeling a bit better. But it will take time, the old say is correct, good days and bad days.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Started back in to my routine. Work. Church. things like that.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"My I suggestion you pick your closest friend, and talk to her/him about your feeling, but not about your boyfriend, about how you feel your friends have been treating you. Be nice but firm. I bet once they hear your pain, they will be very supportive.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I understand that! it is very reasonable to want to be around family and friends during the holidays.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Good! I'm glad helped, even if just a little.<|endoftext|>"
Others,hello! it's nice to meet you.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"ooh wow, she must have really been pushing your nerves to the core right about the Biden win, right?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","well look, One thing I have always learnt about people who push others to the core is that they always have that competitive spirit in them to always want to win while hurting others feelings. what do you think of that.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I get it now. I believe she feels like she has finally gotten what she was yearning for after four years of Trumps administration and now she is elated that her candidate has finally won right?<|endoftext|>
Others,"well, let me ask you something. You've told me that you have been friends with her for a long time meaning that you understand her inside out right?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,wow that's a long time. How about you letting her know how you really feel about what she is doing to you emotionally. What do you think the outcome might be?<|endoftext|>
Information,I'm glad you feel better. but just a parting shot. Sometimes when one let's their friends know what is really bothering them makes the friends trust them more given that they are open with them and could tell them what they feel deep inside. That's what true friendship is about. It works wonders.<|endoftext|>
Others,You are welcome. Bye.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, how can I help you today?<|endoftext|>"

"Reflection of feelings,Question",I am so sorry. It is really so hard right now with COVID. Have you been able to virtually connect with people ??<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,Well I must say that as a woman I would not allow it either ;).<|endoftext|>
Question,It does sound like it. Are there any other problems in your marriage that might be making you unhappy or is it generally okay and you just want someone else too?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you considered getting some sort of marriage guidance counselling? There are people out there who might be able to help you both.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I think it sounds as though you might be pushing her into things she is not ready for though. Have you considered that you might be the problem?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"No, I do not think you should say that! At least you recognise that you are not behaving well, which is the first step on the road to making things better.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Others",Perhaps you could consider individual counselling to overcome your own problems before you think of couples' therapy? Porn can be helpful for a relationship but it can also be damaging.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Well, perhaps it would be better for you to learn that you can't just do that even though you want to :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I am forty five, fat and married :). I do recommend talking to someone though.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I am glad you were able to confide a little in me and hope it is the first step on the road to a happier marriage. I do recommend not giving into your urges and remembering how much you love your wife. I wish you all the best for the future and have a lovely Christmas!<|endoftext|>
Information,(you need to end the conversation from your end - I can't ).<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Oh, I'm sorry, that's not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, it's a positive sign that she hasn't blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That's okay! You shouldn't do anything that isn't fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance","So you're saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct? Ahhhh.,.....yes that;s difficult, oh boy.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"For the time being we're all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. Heck I rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so I know how that feels.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"On the bright side of things, at least you have a job. Do you enjoy your job? Maybe start friendships with coworkers, possibly.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's really hard for people in our situation right now because there's only so many virtual things to attend but maybe I just thought of a virtual cocktail hour, and you could go on Facebook or even meetup.com or a free dating site to connect with other people in our situation who live near you. The book club is a great idea.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Same here, wish I could've been more helpful but we're in similar situations and nothing else came to my mind. Hang in there, you're doing great under the circumstances!<|endoftext|>"

"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question,Question",So you have a full schedule. Are these mandatory classes for your degree. May I aks what your major is.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is it online in person.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Being online makes it harder.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Maybe the in person classes can be restructured, maybe you can change your schedule.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing",My classes are online and I can chose my load. Are the i person classes more important then this class. I would. But before you fail can you drop the class then pick it up in person.<|endoftext|>
Question,Can you talk with your teacher for extra credits.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Is there away to talk with him in person to explain your issue. Ask for his advise in person versus the online.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,So many jobs would be acceptable if they are nearby and are in a related field.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Do you have any contacts in industry that could be of help? That might give you more options. You could also help them find a job, too. Put a favor in the favor bank.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Ok. So in a way, you need to build a new network of industry contacts nearby. Is there an industry group or other club in the area?<|endoftext|>"
Question,How much time can you wait? Time seems to be the gating factor here.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Ok. You think you'll have job opportunities, but maybe not ones that meet your location needs. Are you hoping to spend more time with your family?<|endoftext|>"
Question,It sounds like you have a good handle on your situation. Is there anything else I can help you with?<|endoftext|>
Information,Yes. Time will help you resolve this issue. You will gain perspective on what's out there. More opportunities will come up if you have time to investigate.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's great! I'm glad I was able to help.<|endoftext|>
Others,Ok.<|endoftext|>

"Self-disclosure,Others","I felt the same way when 50% people were laid off from my previous company.  Situation was really stressful all around. I was trying to stay positive and kept working.

Restatement or Paraphrasing,\So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it.<|endoftext|>
Question,So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You must have had good reason's to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it.  Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards.  You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did.  Im sure the reasons are still valid.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up.  In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing.  I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more.  You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with.  I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won't be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make.  Connect with friends you may have lost touch with.  Your going to be great.<|endoftext|>
Others,Your welcome and I love that you are so dedicated to your development.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there something you wish to discuss today?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,If i am to understand you are having troubles with your weight and this is effecting your relationship ?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I to have experienced troubles with my weight, if can be a very troubling issue to deal with.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Could I ask if you are currently participating in any activities or diets to manage your weight ?<|endoftext|>
Information,Research has shown that if you eat at regular meal times the body can regulate your weight better. The trick is to consume less than you use in a day. To manage this its better to eat your recommended daily amount then exercise so you are using up excess energy.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Yes it is a difficult challenge. Have you looked in to local support groups which can help you with motivation?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Thats good, I would suggest that you either join a local group or sign up to a online one. Maybe try one that includes meal plans for the week, support chat group that can motivate you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Exercise is key to weight loss, maybe go for walks with your boyfriend. this will also give you time with him.<|endoftext|>"

Others,Good bye.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you know what might have happened to cause your and your best friend to not talk anymore?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That sounds really stressful and I can see how troubling that is for you.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"That's definitely very upsetting. I know how it feels to have that sense of betrayal from a friend I was close to for many years. However, I was able to discuss the issue I had with my parents and other friends. Do you have anyone else close to you that you can talk to?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That can definitely add to frustration. What about your other friends? Do you have anyone who either shares the same opinion as you or does not know your friend that you can talk to?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"You have every right to be angry, but the most important thing you can do is find a good support system with your other friend. It will take some time to heal, but I'll tell you a paraphrased version of one of my favorite quotes: ""Resentment is like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to die."" It's important to find support in your other friends and heal properly.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That sounds like a wonderful idea. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Can you elaborate more? Earlier you said you and your friend were arguing while she was living in your house, then she stopped talking to you. Why might you be angry with yourself?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"If I may, I would argue that your actions don't make you soft and they certainly don't make you stupid. They are certainly not any reason to be angry with yourself. If I may bring up another cliché: ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."" I would say you're in the ""fool me once"" stage and it is your friend's actions that have brought you pain. I think you're unlikely to trust her again. Also, hindsight is 20/20. What you might see now in ways that your friend might have used you are things that you might not have seen then. We want to think the best of our friends until they prove us wrong. I think you were being the best friend you could be.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others",Of course. I think you'll be alright and remember the healing process can take a long time after betrayal. Remember to be kind to yourself and keep that support system of your other friend by you. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?<|endoftext|>
Others,You too!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Hi! It seems someone in the family is having sleeping issues. Correct me if I am wrong.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Sorry to here about it. It must be hard for you to see her in trouble. May I ask What happen to her.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can feel how stressed you are right now but she will recover fast.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"When my kid have cold, I nebulize her and later it make her sleep well.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Some people says giving green tea helps in cold.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Taking steamed shower helps in cold as well. You can try that too. I will pray for her speedy recovery.<|endoftext|>
Others,Mt best wishes are there with you. Be positive she will sleep well and recover soon.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello there, how is life for you right now?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Well, that sounds vaguely positive but is there something you'd like to talk specifically about?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Have you been having some problems with your friends lately? This can be a very stressful time of year, I know.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,So you are feeling worried deep down about something right now? Would you like to tell me more about ti?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you think that perhaps you feel numb to things that are going on even though you should be worried about them?<|endoftext|>
Others,"I see - that is interesting, I have never heard of anything like that before. Do you think that there might be some sort of physical problem going on?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well, erm, thank you and a very Merry Christmas to you too. Yes fifteen minutes :D. Have you thought of making a list of goals for the New Year to motivate yourself?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I smoke too much too. It costs a lot and it's really bad for my health. I think I am gonna try and quit - again, sigh - in January too.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Maybe try saving the money you save on cigarettes for a few months and then treat yourself to something really nice?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Nearly ten pounds a pack here (UK). I am gonna try and save up for a new handbag!<|endoftext|>
Question,Everything is cheaper there than here :D. Do you have any fun plans for Christmas Day?<|endoftext|>
Others,It will be nice to have a couple of stress free days ... assuming that they are stress free!<|endoftext|>
Others,"I hope you have a really nice Christmas and New Year too. Let's face it, hopefully 2021 cannot be worse than 2020 (touch wood).<|endoftext|>"
Others,Anyway thank you for talking and I hope you feel a little better.<|endoftext|>
Information,Hit the button and take the survey ;). I can't end it from my side.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","i can totally relate to that, I am feeling the same way. how long have you been feeling this way?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"so it sounds like you are feeling cooped up and not knowing what to do, am i right?<|endoftext|>"
Question,can you tell me more?<|endoftext|>
Question,may I ask where you are located?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",it's normal to feel scared.  Of course it being normal doesn't make it any better... can you get out for walks?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions","i see.  are you saying your sidewalks are too busy to be able to social distance properly? i find getting out for walks is helpful.  i live downtown in a small city.   i wear a mask while I walk and veer onto the grass, into the bike lane or whatnot if someone comes...or I look ahead and cross the street if it's convenient...that makes me feel safer when i walk.  i have a medical condition too.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Self-disclosure,Question,Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","what is it that is stopping you, are the sidewalks too crowded? without my walks I'd go crazy...it's my daily stress reliever....i am at home 23 hours a day. are you planning to get a vaccine and if so do you know how long you have to wait? i agree with you it's a scary time...but things will get batter....the more people get vaccinnes, the better things will get for all of us. are you still there?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"so if I understand you correctly, being stuck at home for a whole year is making you feel very sad.   Do you connect with people by telephone, zoom, online, email and so on?  It's important to connect as often as you can with people you care about.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"do you have a back yard or a patio you can go out on, which might be less scary than going for a walk?  Sometimes just the fresh air on my face is a relief.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"thats good you are connecting with people, and have lunch outdoors.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"those are both important strategies for your low mood, keep it up.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"you are so welcome..stay safe, it's been a pleasure listening to you.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So you think she may, have started a relationship with someone else?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Ok, well that doesn't sound pleasant and must be difficult to hear. Perhaps her feelings have changed and there isn't necessarily another person involved?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Ok so it seems like you are quite angry at the moment at the thought of her with someone else, is that true?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I had a similar experience myself. My partner was stressed and I was busy myself. It turns out that I wasn't paying him enough attention and this made him feel like I didn't think he was important to me any more.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"From my experience, when I actually talked to my boyfriend we agreed to make more time for each other and things did improve.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Sometimes people say one thing but actually mean another. They are complicated and don't always say what they really mean.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I cannot say for certain however I think you should talk to her but also prepare yourself for the fact that she may actually want to spend some time apart or end  the relationship. it would be wise to prepare for that outcome as upsetting as it may be.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I think you are reflecting on your plans together and the thought of the relationship ending is making you upset and angry.<|endoftext|>
Information,Ok so based on what you have told me I think that your girlfriend has got a new job and you are planning on moving in together is that correct?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It is but that is a lot of change all happening at once. Perhaps she is getting a little bit scared and rather than dealing with the situation she is running away, perhaps you should talk about this and see how she responds?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you got any evidence of this like seen a text message or has she behaves strangely?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Ok well it is natural to feel like this sometimes. People tend to fear the worst.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I think rather than ask her that question directly, you could start the conversation and ask her why she is feeling this way. This would show you care and are prepared to listen without jumping to conclusions.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"The best thing to do would be prepared to have the conversation, stay calm and listen. She may just want to talk but also be prepared as it may not go the way you plan.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Be prepared that she may end the relationship but getting angry is likely not to change her mind. Getting angry does not improve difficult conversations.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Take a deep breath and try to relax beforehand. Staying positive and allowing her to speak will make for a better conversation. She will be more likely to open up to you.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope you manage to work it through and can at least talk about your feelings.<|endoftext|>
Others,You are very welcome and take care.<|endoftext|>
Question,That is good.  Is everthing ok?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,So your having a hard time fiding a job.  I'm sure something will come up.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Times are hard for many right now.  You are not alone.  I myself lost a job not long again and it took me awhile to find a new one.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Well, I just keep appling and applying.  I got down but keep at it.  In the meantime I did some work for UBER, INSTACART, etc.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"There are other options.  There is dog walking, house sitting, handy man work, etc?  I'm sure you are good at things like that.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"No, but you never know who you are going to meat.  The more people you work for, the more contacts, etc you have.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Sometimes, you just have to have hope.  I know you will find a job.  You will find something better.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,You are welcome.  I truly believe in you and what I say.  You are not alone in this.  So many are struggling right now.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others",I have been where you are.  I have stuggeling  with finding a job.  You will find one. Have a great day.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi, how's things?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am afraid that I am not able to see that .. can you tell me about it?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Information",Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps? There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions",Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do. I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings",Really though I think that your problem is self esteem .. you should think better of yourself :). I can tell that you set yourself a very high standard but I also think that you need to be kind to yourself.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others,Others",I can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life. Have you tried to take anything to help? I can recommend a hot milky drink before bed and perhaps a hot water bottle. Anyway I hope that I have been able to be of some assistance to you! Have a lovely holiday season.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,And you :) remember to hit the quit button and take the survey ;).<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Oh wow I am sorry to hear that - it is a bad time to be out of work isn't it?<|endoftext|>
Information,There are organisations out there who can help due to the exceptional circumstances .. do you have anyone helping you?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Hmm, could you google for local organisations such as Citizen's Advice? I have found them very useful personally.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"They provided me with loads of helpful advice and other people to get in touch with. Also, have you considered using a food bank?<|endoftext|>"
Information,There are religious organisations that can sometimes help too and would not expect you to be of their religion.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Try not to worry about it - it is not just you. The job market is awful right now but it will pick up again!<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you eligible for unemployment benefits?<|endoftext|>
Information,"But surely you should be eligible anyway, unless you just walked out.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Wow that is really not fair of them! I think you have grounds for legal action there.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","You really should - nobody has the right to dismiss you due to your health problems, that is totally outrageous. I realise the prospect of legal action can be daunting and potentially expensive but you should be able to get legal aid and it sounds as though you really have been badly treated here.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",You'd need to get legal aid. Try and find a solicitor who works pro bono. Anyway I hope that I have been able to give you some help and guidance and that things look up for you in the very near future! Try to hang in there.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others,Providing Suggestions","That's great .. I really hope it works out for you. Don't worry, you're not the only one to be in this situation and things can and do pick up. Thanks for talking! Can you press quit and take the survey - I am not able to from this end :).<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm so sorry to hear that.  How is that affecting you? I'm so sorry to hear that.  How is that affecting you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm so sorry that you feel sad about the situation.<|endoftext|>
Question,What makes you think you are neglecting other important aspects in your life?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds difficult.  You sound like a strong person still persevering in your Masters even through this difficult time even if you can't pay attention as closely as before.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I remember a bad breakup too where I wasn't sure how the future would go.  It can be scary not knowing what will come. It sounds like having a Master's degree can really help you be independent though.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I had to repeat a class and it took an extra year to finish my graduate school.  The feeling of accomplishment and grit I developed made a huge difference though in my future abilities to cope with major stresses.  You too will come out stronger.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds like a great plan.  You sound like a very motivated person getting a masters degree is so difficult and you are working toward it. You will do well.  I wish you all the best.<|endoftext|>
Question,Perhaps there is a counselor at school that could help you with reworking through some of your goals?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,There may be other students as well who are going through the same things as you that you could chat with.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Absolutely.  I think things will turn around for you.  You have a lot going for you and are very intelligent.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Things will get better with time.  Keep pursuing your dreams. Is there anything else I can help you with?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am okay. How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Question,What has happened?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know a lot of people who are feeling this way.   It is a difficult time.<|endoftext|>
Question,Why do you think you are struggling?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you are feeling lonely. Is that right?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I understand. Video calls can feel a bit less personal sometimes. Do you live alone?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I see. So you aren't even getting that social contact at work really. Do you video chat to your family and friends regularly?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I feel the same way. Having to keep in contact with friends through video has been difficult lately. I try to find something to do while we're chatting, like gaming or a quiz.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hello! What would you like to talk about today?<|endoftext|>
Question,Can you tell me more about this anxiety?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am here, it seems that you don't feel like you've studied enough. Is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question",It truly depends on the subject! There are online sites that provide free additional instruction. Can you tell me what the class is?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Khan Academy is absolutely fantastic! It is extremely helpful and accurate since it is run by educators.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,No but I am a former math teacher and I would give them to my students!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am so glad! I know online school is stressful but I think you can do it.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I can recommend other resources if you'd like.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"If this is an upper level math course, you can go to university sites! They always have lessons.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Of course! Did you have any other questions?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Good luck studying! You're capable of doing well!<|endoftext|>
Others,You can terminate the convo at any time!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question","Oh, That is a very large amount of money. I can understand your being upset with them. Have you talked to them about the money and returning it?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments?<|endoftext|>
Question,Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I see. I am very sorry about that! it is very difficult when a friend betrays your trust like that.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you are doing what you can. It is very nice of you to have been this patient.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Is the friendship more important than the money? That is what it came down to for me.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"If you can not get her to meet with you, perhaps it might be time to seek advice from a lawyer? That is providing that you are willing to possibly lose a friend.<|endoftext|>"
Others,you are welcome. Good luck! I hope you find resolution and find a way to save your friendship!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Not bad, it's a peaceful night. Anything in particular you'd like to talk about?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I imagine that's very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well-being?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Others",I'm sorry that you're having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It's scary for everyone at this point.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you've already attempted to discuss it with? Yeah you're right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could've never prepared for.<|endoftext|>
Others,I mean all you can do is try your best to stay safe but I would continue to reach out to people higher up and see about getting something done. They probably get a lot of calls and emails right now because of everything going on but I would keep trying.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Thank you for talking with me too! I hope it has helped some. At least you know you're not alone...<|endoftext|>
Others,You're welcome. I wish you the best and many blessings.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Your partner has left you? I am very sorry to hear that. How long were you together for?<|endoftext|>
Question,Wow that is a really long time. I can understand why you are feeling so lousy. Is there any chance of reconciliation?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I remember when my partner left me after eight years I felt that I was never going to get over it. I was angry and miserable for a very long time.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance",Yes it has been a really terrible year for all of us. I am so sorry that this happened to you on top of everything else! I know how bad it feels but I can promise you that it will fade after time.<|endoftext|>
Others,Ah dogs are absolutely wonderful companions aren't they? Especially when the world is so isolated right now.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,What breed of dog is she? I have two cats and they have been really helping me when I've been feeling low.<|endoftext|>
Others,Rescues are the best. My two are rescues and it took them a while to trust me but now they love me unconditionally. It is good that you have a pet in your life .. much better than your useless ex I think!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"LOL well it's good that you are able to look on the bright side about this. Have you considered making plans for the future, once the pandemic is over?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","I am sorry to hear about your heart condition, that obvious compounds your problems. I believe that things are going to improve in the New Year though. Let's face it, there does come a time when it seems that not much can get worse.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Try to look on the bright side of things :) At least you can't be dumped twice ;).<|endoftext|>
Others,"I hope that one day you feel that you will be able to date and trust another person though. Don't let one bad apple put you off for life. Anyway it has been very nice to chat, I hope that I was able to be of help.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Enjoy the rest of your day!<|endoftext|>
Others,Hello! How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am so sorry to hear that, I'd love to understand more about what you are struggling with?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Academic probation does seem very scary. When did you learn you failed your finals?<|endoftext|>
Others,And how long do you have until graduation?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I see. Well it's nice that we matched up! I actually work at a college and now a couple good strategies to get off academic probation, and or avoid it! What is it you are studying?<|endoftext|>"
Others,Oh that is awesome! So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health. I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this. But I want to reassure you that your mental health should always come first. It is the most important thing you can do.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You are definitely not a failure in the slightest! In fact, I would argue that you are the exact opposite of that. Being able to take such difficult courses in a pandemic, and raise a child shows how strong you are!<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","And you will succeed in that goal. You have the motivation and the care for it, you just need to focus on managing everything at once! Have you thought about meeting with an academic advisor and laying out a plan?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Unfortunately yes and it's been worse this year. I have tried certain coping mechanisms but some work better than others.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",I have been trying to do as much walking as is allowed by the pandemic rule. I do love to get fresh air even though we're not allowed to go far. Have you been getting help for your depression?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Information","Well alcohol, but I do not necessarily recommend that. Do you have many friends that you can talk to? There are also counselling services out there that you might be able to access for free.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question",I have suffered from depression for many years so I can totally empathise with you. Is there any specific area that I could help you with?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I think that this just proves that you are human! I can understand that you are feeling really bad though and I'd like to help.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope that I have been able to be of some help. It's sometimes hard to know what to say.<|endoftext|>
Others,I wish you all the very best!<|endoftext|>
Others,yes of course.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well, I think you need to find a hobby that will help you and that will enable you to make new friends.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Anyway it's been nice to talk, all the best!<|endoftext|>"
Question,What was the mistake? Was it too serious?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance",Is that your first time making that mistake? If so i'm sure your manager will tell you to make sure in case for next time.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Mistakes happen, they are unavoidable, and your manager should know this so since it is your first time he should take it easy. Just make sure it doesn't happen again because you need to learn from this mistake :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If you can't breath normally, then I think it is best to start to meditate in order to control your breathing and make you less stressed.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yes, meditation is extremely useful, and I also use it when I feel stressed.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Maybe play calm classical music and start slowly reminiscing about the days previous, and your future ahead. or you could just wacth a youtube tutorial, either one works fine.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","It is all in the aid of calming yourself down, and your welcome :). and knowing it is your first offense, probably not but always prepare for the worst.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","5 years is a very long time, so I don't think that you will be given the pink slip. I know it would be hard to find a new job, which is why you should always be prepared.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"If you believe in yourself, things will work out somehow :).<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, thats the spirit!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Your welcome! There is always someone to talk to.<|endoftext|>
Others,You too!<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you have anything specific on your mind?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh, it seems like you are feeling alone, is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
Others,Do you have a list of things in any order?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds very difficult for you and great job reaching out here today.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can telling that you are very worried but also very capable because you have taking the time to search for some support.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Well, I used to feel the same way and I would take the time to call a close friend and spend time with my dogs everyday. Is that something you could do too?<|endoftext|>"
Others,That is very forward thinking and a great idea. A local church group can often support you.<|endoftext|>
Information,"I understand, I have noticed that people who reach our for help as you have will attract people to them. Have you looked into an online church community?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, I agree that it is hard to find people who can help and not cause more harm. Online communities on reddit have specialized groups for people with your situation too.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, I agree. Having time to sit down and write out your thoughts and feelings can sometimes help too. Maybe you can journal your feelings this week.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes, you have started your journey today and I am very proud of you expressing and identifying your problems. Great first step.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes, please use writing to list your feelings and problems this week and check back with us regularly. We are happy to help and always here for you. Thank you very much.<|endoftext|>"
Information,You can reach out anytime or day and we will assist you.<|endoftext|>
Others,"You're welcome, Bye.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"If you don't need anything else, you can kindly, end and finish for today. Thanks.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh wow, i am so sorry to hear that. You must be feeling so anxious and nervous.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know, it seems like everyone is in the same boat. You should know that you're not alone in this, i am so sorry.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried reaching out to a career counselor or recruiter?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"That is awful, I know that my good friend was laid off recently. He has been using the time to worko n his resume but to also catch up on some family time. Have you been able to see any family?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Oh i'm so sorry. I didn't know you were sick. How are you feeling now/?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's so not right. I am happy that you are doing better now. It sounds like the job may not have been the right plce anyways if they are willing to let you go because of that.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You and your husband should try to do something to take your mind off it. You can try to do a date night or something. i Know that really helps me!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I know the feeling. MY husband is also in year end stuff piling up so it always feels like we don't get to spend time together. Try to carve a hour out on the weekend.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Definitely! it's always helpful to have another set of eyes on it. I have faith that things will get better for you and try to focus on the positive. Like the fact that you have a husband who wants ot be there for you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Have you tried checking online? sometimes if you google it, you can find message boards with more information on when itw ill be open.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Hello!<|endoftext|>
Question,How are you?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",Oh I understand how that can be. Would you like to tell me about it?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",I can understand how that can become a source of frustration after a while. Would you like to share what pushed it beyond the normal point today?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",I can relate because I also have a close friend that seeks constant reaffirmations. Have you spoken with her about this?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions","Sometimes it is very difficult to see yourself through someone elses eyes when you undervalue yourself. I know it may be difficult to remain patient when your friend repeatedly does this, but maybe you could explain to her that it makes you feel like she is mistrustful of your opinion when she second guesses your taste in friends.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Self-disclosure",Possibly explaining it in a way she can relate to would be helpful. I did in fact speak with my friend and it helped our relationship quite a bit. We continue to be very close 20 years later.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I can feel your frustration just by our conversation, and I too wish that she could see that you value both her and your friendship enough to reach out to someone that can just listen. Don't forget that your feelings are valid as well.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Sometimes you have to take a step back and fill your own cup.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",Do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship? Do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship? It has been my pleasure! I trust you will make the right choice! Best of wishes!<|endoftext|>

Question,"Hello, would you like to explain your situation and we can go through  it together.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So you don't feel motivated and you are not scoring well, have I understood that correctly?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What are you currently studying?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Your motivation and how you are studying is probably related, you are right. What attracted you to microbiology in the first place?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It is never too late to change anything. However, i hear that you have always found it fascinating,have you considered talking to your uncle and seeing if you can find what you loved about it again?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Studying can be really difficult , especially when you are half way through. i struggled in my studies and found that talking to my tutors helped and approaching student support. Have you tried anything like that or has your motivation held you back?<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"One suggestion is for you to write down all the reasons that you love microbiology. It can be any format, I love a bubble chart (mind map), it could be in list form or just doodles, would this be something you would find useful?<|endoftext|>"
Question,It would be a really good place to start. Then you could be really kind to yourself and take some pressure off. Would you like to talk through some ideas to help with the work itself?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. Often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. One thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question. Would that be something that would help?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It could be something you can try, remember , it is not always about ought to, simply how can I make it easier for myself. It is okay to get things wrong too. If you decide to write your list of reasons why you love microbiology, maybe you could keep it in a place you see every day, a mirror or fridge and keep seeing where you are trying to get to.<|endoftext|>"

Information,"It is hard. Unfortunately you can only try to direct them to stop for so long before it can really damage your own well being, which should come first.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I would actually suggest just that. If you have tried, or do not even feel like going down that path. Then that is your decision. You should look out for yourself!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"The thing is with drugs, that person already abandoned themselves. Sometimes they can get the help they need, but they need to do it on their own terms. Its kind of like a blackhole where everything gets sucked into their life.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Me too, i dont know how many bridges i burned all those years ago.<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,Just in the conversation I can see how stressed out you are and struggling with how to handle that.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Sometimes talking with a close friend can help. Have you tried that?<|endoftext|>

"Self-disclosure,Question",I do understand. I've tried therapy myself and was very hesitant at first. But after a while I found it really did help. Do you feel ready to tell me what specifically is wrong?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well, let's take these one at a time. Firstly, is there something you could do to make friends? Join a group of some kind?<|endoftext|>"

Does that sound right?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I understand these feelings very well. Sometimes, my fear overshadows my want for help. I find it easier to open up to others through writing rather than face to face. Have you considered putting your feelings in writing and opening up to trusted friends and family in this way?<|endoftext|>"

Others,It's been my pleasure. I wish you good luck!<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,Yeah even i can see that when i see my daughters class. It is a bad situation all around. The thing is though you cant focus on that or it will bleed out into your job. You have to try to stay positive and promote positivity even with how hard it can be.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Self-disclosure",Oh sorry i guess it came off wrong. I meant try not to let it overwhelm you so you can focus more on the kids. I know my kids school has had issues with parents not being there or helping and they were able to intervene. Is that not available at your school?<|endoftext|>
Others,I am sorry to hear that i really am.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","Yeah i know, and schools have had since march of last year to really prepare but it feels like they left everything to the last minute. I know my distract didnt even have a plan for remote until the last week of august. Sometimes its good to just vent like this though. Get a bit of perspective.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to. Things like that are important! How long have you guys been together?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",Oh I see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you? Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her! Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore. And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just ""kicking her to the curb."" Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","What I've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding. Yes I think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps. You are welcome! :).<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Of course! And it wouldn't be fair to her, just as much as it wouldn't be fair to you. Your happiness is just as important!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Of course! I'm glad that you are feeling a bit better about everything! You as well!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, what seems to be on your mind?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I see. How long have your two friends been arguing?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now, is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","Well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other. Why do you think your one friends shared a secret they were.supposed to keep?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I think I understand. Sometimes we accidentally hurt the people we love when we are trying to help.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think it is great that you want to actively help, it says a lot about you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Sometimes the best way to help someone understand is to give them a little time and space. Trying to force someone to understand doesn't always work.

"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",You could also try talking to your hurt friend like this and ask her if she thinks the other friend truly meant to hurt her. I bet she knows that wasn't the case. I bet you guys will all be friends again in no time.<|endoftext|>
Others,You as well!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can see you are trying hard but aren't feeling acknowledged.<|endoftext|>
Question,What is it that they aren't affirming you on?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I see that can be frustrating.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I see that you are communicating to them but they don't understand where you are coming from.  That can be frustrating.<|endoftext|>
Question,When did this start?<|endoftext|>
Question,When my children were in the same situation I felt a lot of heat too from my parents.  It's helpful sometimes to talk to a school counselor.  Have you tried that at all?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,They have some experience with other families and maybe could connect you with people who are having similar issues. I've done that in the past.<|endoftext|>

Perhaps you could narrow your search to find those as well, if you haven't already. Alright, you might want to start by taking deep breaths, and remember that this will not be the end of it all. Your wife's reassurance is very valid, and I'm sure she doesn't blame you.

I know in my own life I have had some problems that were too big to deal with by myself.  I had to find help.   It's not a sign of weakness, it's a strength.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","I think it's great you are AWARE you have a problem, that's the most important and often the hardest first step, and you have accomplished that. Are your friends drinking with you?   Do they know you are trying to drink less? I can understand that being busy can be a barrier, but you are WORTH making time for.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,My daughter had to find new friends to stay away from the drugs...she has made some good friends at AA. I know when I quit smoking I had to stay away from my smoking friends for a while until I felt strong enough to be around it.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","Well lets se we've talked about AA, finding an addiction counsellor, and spending time away from your dr\inking friends for a while, you can explain to them why.  If they can't support you in your efforts, are they being good friends to you? Maybe you could also do an internet search to find out what services are available in your city or town. I know for me, I have had to put my mental health first.  I've had mental health challenges.   And without my health I have nothing, so it's #1 priority for me.   Perhaps giving up alcohol can become your #1 priority.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,you are very welcome it's been a pleasure speaking with you.  I know you can get through this and achieve your goal.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",:)  That's so good to hear you say. Was there anything else?<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am also doing well, thank you for asking! :) What did you come here to talk about?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh I see. Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from. But you shouldn't feel upset at yourself for how you are feeling. It is completely normal, and I'm sure all your friends are feeling the same way! I have a few things I would like to share with you about how I have been getting through it. Maybe it will help you out :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done. It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed.<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions","Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :). You could also plan out your days if it would help! Try and find time for the things that will bring you joy, whether that involves waking up earlier, or moving some routine things around.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"It is definitely hard, but it's important for your mental health to keep the people you love close to you :).<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Yes exactly. And yeah that will be so nice when we are finally able to leave again and feel normal. But unfortunately we can't wait around for that since it's so up in the air recently. So I'm glad that you are wanting to change little things in your life to keep you happy until then.<|endoftext|>

Question,"Hi, I am here to support you in anyway that I can how is your day going?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","I understand what you are saying and have felt low at times in my life too. I am proud of you for reaching out for help and trying to get a new perceptive. You are making progress today. Do you think it would help to give me an example of a time when you lose interest? Maybe it will help if I share something that I have been experiencing lately. Recently, anytime that I watch a love story or a romantic comedy I become so sad that I end up crying through the end of it and needing to lay down from exhaustion.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Okay, so youre saying that when you try to focus on tv you are unable to do so?<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,Have you ever tried to journal your thoughts?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Wonderful! I recommend ending each day with a journal entry and the record how you are feeling over all every three days.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You're welcome! I also like to ask people if they are exercising because I find that it helps me and my mental health.<|endoftext|>
Information,Thats is positive news. Have you ever tried doing yoga? I find that it is low strain on your body and can help with creating a quiet moment in your day.<|endoftext|>
Question,What is stressing you out? Maybe I can encourage you.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Your home work balance, are you working from home?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can understand that you would feel lonely. Isolation is not healthy for any of us. It seems to be forced on us. Have you any friends or family you could call on the phone?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It is true, it feels terrible to not go out. We don't listen to the government anymore because we don't know anyone who died, so we still meet with our friends. I would be lost without them, however we don't meet as much so I do make it a point to call them. What will happen if you leave your home?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you have a lot of friends how were healthy that died?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have found that being in isolation lowers my immunity, and if I want to be healthy, fresh air, loving friends, exercise, good healthy food is the way to do it, not isolation and loneliness. That affect me emotionally and I don't want to despair, that makes me feel terrible. It doesn't feel healthy, and we know no one that has died either.  But if you are not going to go out, do you have goals to help you not feel lonely, any ideas? Any thoughts on how you can fix this so you don't feel so lonely?<|endoftext|>"
Information,You might even want to call your friends and colleagues to see if any of them are meeting up. We are social creatures. We need to socialize.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sure you are busy, but realize, your emotional health is important too and we always need to make time to connect with people.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","I think it is a trade off for us -- do we risk a disease we have a 99.9996% chance of survival from according to the CDC or stay at home and despair?  I see no evidence of a pandemic nor do my nurse friends. So we live our lives normally. But some are afraid, and fear takes its toll on people. I say use your eyes, look around, if there aren't people dying all around you and you aren't hearing of a lot of people dying in ten months of this, there probably aren't a lot of people dying. And life is short. Hug those you love, you may not have them tomorrow, plandemic or not. I know you are working hard, but do try to switch up your life so you get some exercise and take care of your health, and perhaps list some people to call who you haven't checked in with in a while to switch up your life, bring some pizzazz. I was feeling REALLY lonely last month, and then I started a gratitude list and that helped, then I called some people and began to make new friends. It really helped a lot.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance,Others,Information","Thank you for your kind words!  You should invite your friends. I don't think living in fear is actually living. It feels like death. I know a lot of people who would LOVE a home cooked meal, and sharing a meal together is so emotionally fulfilling. Is there anything else I can help you with? If not, you have to close out the hit so we can finish the conversation and get paid! :D.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Hello, How are you?<|endoftext|>"
Others,could you tell me more about that?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm very sorry to hear that.  Do you know where you are moving?<|endoftext|>
Information,That is a difficult situation. Have you been working with a realtor?<|endoftext|>

Question,"Tell me about your job search. Also, what experience do you have?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Does CSR stand for Customer Service Representative?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, CSR and experience in Banking must mean you have some skills that are in high-demand. Many companies need CSR's, and Banks are always hiring. Skills needed for CSR are very translatable to other customer service jobs, sales, and more!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sure you will find something very quickly.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"I see, so it sounds like you need a job search tool that will save you time.  I'd recommend putting your profile on LinkedIn, and/or checking a job aggregator like Indeed or Glassdoor. There, you can view and apply for several jobs.

Self-disclosure,"I have also had anxiety in the past when in public places, so I know how it feels to be anxious while out.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Another thing that may help is having some headphones in attached to your phone or an MP3 player so you can have some calming music or something in your ear while you are out.<|endoftext|>

Others,Whatever music you think would be best would be a good idea.<|endoftext|>

If you have a plan already it will ease some of that anxiety that will come from this tough situation.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Unfortunately, life doesnt always do what we want. What we can do is plan ahead though. It will make you less anxious if you know you have a back up plan.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I know that is a really rough thing to go through. Do you have anyone at home you can talk to as well? Just letting it out helps sometimes.<|endoftext|>
Information,"It might make you feel a bit better, maybe they can give you some perspective as well.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Its not something that will go away instantly, its something you have to work at. If it is really affecting your life in a negative way, talking to a therapist might really help you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Im glad you think so.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Im glad, before then, what helps me calm down is going for a nice hike or run. It really lets me clear my head. Do you have anything you like to do to recenter yourself?<|endoftext|>"

"Information,Providing Suggestions",That is a fabulous idea. A pet will help with your bond. Can you work with your injury? I have heard of online support groups that can help with support from work injuries. I would love to share with you some ideas about emotionally healing in conjunction with your physical. An animal that you could rescue from a shelter could be a way to work your hand and do some therapy.<|endoftext|>

Question,hello.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Sure, what is going on?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am truly sorry you had to witness that. Would you feel more comfortable with them leaving or do you think either relationship is salvagable?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,If you feel that something might be salvageable it might be worth looking into. Do you think they'd be open to sitting down and talking it out?<|endoftext|>
Others,"I think that either way you choose to proceed there is always the choice of remaining amicable. You're all adults, so sitting down and discussing what comes next is an inevitability. Maybe they will choose to leave, or you'll decide it would be better for you to go, but at least the discussion would be ongoing to perhaps resume the friendship at a later time?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,If you're trying your best to move on and the other party ends up with hateful feelings then I feel like at least you gave it your best right? It might be worth laying low for a little while to sort through the feelings of mistrust and betrayal.<|endoftext|>
Others,I'm glad I could help.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would talk to them as soon as you feel comfortable enough to do so. It might get awkward and leave people to come to other conclusions if it's avoided for too long.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is completely understandable. Maybe take a day or two to collect your thoughts. Do you have somewhere to be alone to sift through your feelings?<|endoftext|>
Others,How are you?<|endoftext|>

Also being away from your friends and family can cause feelings of doubt because you may not feel like you have trusted ones to lean on.However.

Others,That is very rough. Have you considered joining internet communities so you can at least talk with people who are in the same situation?<|endoftext|>
Others,"I think it really could, yes. Isolation is a very difficult thing to deal with. Just knowing someone else understood could really help.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,There is absolutely no problem with feeling bad and confiding in people. Many people are feeling the same right now.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel as though life is just passing you by and you are not accomplishing anything during the lockdown?<|endoftext|>

Question,"That does sound upsetting.   So how do you two make peace generally, or do you have silences between you?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","So what helps you deal with it?  I have found journaling so helpful when I have personal conflicts.  It helps to get things in perspective, and to vent to a peice of paper. Actually I journal on my computer, and don't save it :).<|endoftext|>"

They have to be small, reasonable tasks, but also an amount of time that allows you to take it one bite at a time. I mean, think about it, how do you eat a cow?<|endoftext|>"

Question,Hi Larry.  What sort of job do you do?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Restatement or Paraphrasing","I have had jobs that seemed pointless as well.   I was a sales assistant in a store constantly waiting for customers, it was boring!  Just a paycheque with no fulfillment.  I found it depressing as well. So it sounds like you are finding no point to going in to work, and it's making you feel sad, am I correct?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Are there other jobs available in your area that you could apply for that are more up your alley?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I see., yes that could be a risk for sure.have you spoken to your manager to see if there may be other opportunities in the manufacturing facility for you?   I bet they would rather retrain you for a different position than lose you.<|endoftext|>"

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Lets hope the new manager improves things for you, it sounds like there is a ray of hope there! Yes it's hard to get started on anything when we are down.  I remember writing lists with very small goals on them.  Small goals feel like mountains when we are down!   Then I would work my way through that very short list and check things off if I could do them, which gave me a small lift of accomplishment.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Lets hope the new manager can improve things.   And your work with the psychologist is very positive, it's great you reached out for help, that is a strength.   You've spoken with your boss.   You are doing all the right things.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"What industry do you work in? With the pandemic, a lot of interviews are done through Zoom and of course not everyone is at the best through video.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"That's rough :/ I assist in managing some Airbnb properties and they've been hit so hard because of the pandemic. At least there's a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine. Honestly I had one friend who had been looking for a job for over a year and he just got an offer last month. They just kept persevering, even if that included applying to 30+ jobs each week.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,My friend works in tech (I don't know what exactly he does since it all goes over my head lol) but I know that he took a lesser position and smaller pay than he had before.

Providing Suggestions,"I hear that, we are only doing it for just our house this year. Have you considered doing something virtual?<|endoftext|>"

Others,"yes! not a whole lot honestly, but i like it.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Have you visited them ever since?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,If they are your pets you should be able to keep them but you did the right thing as to not argue with your brother and your parents could  help you look after them.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,I am sorry to hear that your friends have been so distant lately.  Have you tried to ask them why they have been this way?<|endoftext|>

Question,What hobbies or activities do you like to do?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",Field hockey that sounds like an exciting sport to play!  That does sound like it would keep you busy. Have you thought about the possibility of meeting people online that share some of the same things that you like to do and that you could talk to ?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I understand that you feel that you would look desperate but you said you like reading book so there may be some online book clubs that you could join.  I know that I have been involved in those and I didn't feel like I was seen as desperate since there are so many people that want to be social but don't want to put themselves at risk.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,I assume you are full time.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","So you seem qualified for the position, have you been able to ask why he overlooked you. Being overlooked because of personal reasons should not  be a reason to offer the position to an outsider.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question",It would affect me as well if I was overlooked and the position was offered to an outsider. Is he mean towards others or just you.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance",Are his tempers basically towards you because you are full time. There is no reason to be petty. You have a legitimate reasoning to your feelings.<|endoftext|>
Question,hate to ask but have the 2 of you been close before.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Providing Suggestions",is there an arbitrator you can involve to discuss the matter. Sometimes a mediator can help with the situation.<|endoftext|>

Question,How are your boys feeling about it?<|endoftext|>

"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","i'm very sorry to hear about your mother's passing, and a significant loss like that can take some time to  process. from my experience, it really helps just to open up to someone about the things that are on your mind. even a journal can help. if you have someone who can lend an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on, spending some time with them can help you get your feelings out and might give you a sense of relief.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"personally, i find that hobbies are great for getting your mind off things and keeping yourself occupied means that your mind doesn't wander into dark thoughts.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn't mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,That's a personal choice you're completely allowed to make. It sounds like you have a good foundation for building on your ability to cope.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Providing Suggestions",Understandable. Do you talk with a therapist or have someone you trust you like to talk to?<|endoftext|>

Question,Are you going to have to be around your parents soon after this?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Oof, I see.  I can understand you being upset by that, it's a silly reason to disapprove.  Was the blowout in any way productive or just angry?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I don't know that this problem will be solved with one single choice or conversation.  Do you live with your parents?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ah, well then their opinion of your romantic relationships is 100% irrelevant.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"There's not an easy way to get people to let go of those kinds of beliefs.  Yes, you did mention that, haha.  Physical attraction is awesome but perhaps not the best basis to move someone in with you :-).<|endoftext|>"
Others,I'm good but what make you say you could be better?<|endoftext|>
Question,Why didn't you report it?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",You should report it because at least the boss knows that you are honest with your actions. I don't think you won't lose it straight away if it is your first mistake.<|endoftext|>
Others,"It's never too late, and it would be better to do it now than let him find out himself :).<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Yes but if you report it now you still have a chance of being let off, but if u don't report it now, you would almost certainly lose your job. In any case, always prepare for the worst circumstance at this point.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"In any case, it is always better to tell the truth, because you don't want to have the truth boiling up inside of you for a long time. Thats what I say.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Knowing the severity of the mistake, i think you should tell as good things come to people who are honest :). But about your depression, try to occupy yourself with more work and maybe your boss will see that you have changed your ways.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I think you should work extremely hard during the shift so the boss thinks you have changed your ways, at the end of the shift. As long as you tell its up to you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yeah, but start preparing for the worst now:).<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm sorry to hear that. It is a tough time right now for people working. Do you want to talk about it more?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","I understand that it is frustrating and scary to lose a job. But depending on what field you work in, there are actually quite a few places hiring right now because of the holidays. My boyfriend was laid off from his job and was able to get interviews with a handful of places in his area. Granted, they are not dream jobs, but at least it is a paycheck.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Do you have access to any areas outside your town that are in driving distance or a bus can reach?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well if you have a car, maybe you would be able to find something a little outside your area that would pay more. Try taking a look on indeed.com or even craigslist for open positions. You may be surprised by what you find and a change in career can sometimes be a positive thing.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"The only way you are going to be able to get a job is by looking what is out there. If you can work retail, it is a great time for that because of the holidays. Even if it is a temp position, at least it is something.<|endoftext|>"
Information,It is a difficult time in general for a lot of people. I think most people are going to be understanding this year when it comes to gift giving. I wouldn't worry too much about that and instead focus on what you are able to do about the situation.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps think of you just being home as the gift. Having time to spend with your family and friends is likely to mean more than something you can buy.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Then make it a great experience in the house. Make decorations and do holiday things. There is a lot people can do this time of year without going outside that is fun and meaningful. Try to be optimistic even in tough times. Sometimes it is all we can do to get by.<|endoftext|>
Information,Yeah! That is a great idea. I know people that started doing that and ended up opening their own local brewery. You never know what could happen when you try new things!<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Okay, so from what I have read you are anxious because you have a project and an exam going on and you are struggling in another, is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","I can tell just from these few messages how anxious you are about these things. I am currently in college too, and I completely understand the anxiety around your project and your exams.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you talked to the professor in the class you are struggling in about ways he can help you learn better? I have found that speaking with my professors when I was struggling and explaining why has helped me in the past.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Is there anyone in your class that you are close to that you can reach out to?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you thought about reaching out to a tutor who has previously taken this course to help with the assignments?<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"About resume, one of my friends added his picture wearing a Trump tie on his resume  lol . I thought it was weird but whatever it makes it noticeable could help. Or you could start your own business as you have already tried as a YouTuber. I heard a lot of people starts their own because of Covid.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Have you talked to your friend about your feelings?<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,"It is not easy to be put in a place where you feel you need to choose between two people. Do you think girl code or the husband-wife code is more important? What do you value most, holding a secret or honesty?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I agree with you. With that said, you trust your values and where they lie.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I think one step I would take if i was you would be to discuss the issue with your friend. I would tell her that as a friend, she should value your values. I would tell her the distress you feel.<|endoftext|>"

Question,What subject matter is it for? What have you done to prepare for it? What level of schooling are you in now?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","Papers can be very stressful, especially when it is a group project. When I went to graduate school I had to complete 4 full papers on different subjects in 72 hours. Do you feel like you've made progress in finding the necessary information?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm sure that if everyone puts in the effort, you will all be successful with your paper.  Is there anything I can do to help?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I can tell you're stressed about it and group projects are very hard.  Perhaps you can all put a plan together an allocate tasks to make sure that everyone puts in their share of the work? Is that something you've considered?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I've been in this situation.  Instead of stressing yourself about it, have you tried speaking to your professor or other group mates about making sure that everyone pulls their weight? Some professors take that into consideration.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,I wonder if you can contact the professor and go over your exam with him/her to set your anxiety at ease?<|endoftext|>
Question,how do you get your exam grade and test papers back?<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"Ok, I understand. Have you tried reaching out to their family members as they may have a loser handle on how this person is feeling at the moment?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You could try reaching out to friends on Facebook or social media, you can find contact details for them that way and perhaps send them a direct message. You are a concerned friend which means they probably wouldn't mind if you did get in touch.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I had a friend once that was acting out of character. They weren't quiet but I could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions","That is true. Mental health issues have increased  significantly since lockdowns began. As they are not responding to your attempts to get in touch, you could think has anything else changed for them other than lockdown, for example are they busier at work? have childcare commitments? Life is complicated, they may not have the time for legitimate reasons.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You mentioned that other friends were also concerned about them, have you tried talking to them about setting up a video call with a group. This might appeal to your friend and they may see this as a fun activity to get involved in.<|endoftext|>"
Others,No problem happy to help.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That sounds really hard! Does that mean things tend to escalate quickly in your home?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","That sounds really challenging. I grew up in a home with a lot of yelling, and after a few years it just became our default for communicating with each other. I really regret that we didn't do anything to change the pattern sooner. What have you tried to break the pattern so far?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Restatement or Paraphrasing",That sounds like you're trying really hard to set a good example. It also sounds like you think they may have learned that yelling is okay from their schools. Is that right?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I understand that - I've spent a lot of time trying to teach myself to be better than the home I grew up in.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","Ahaha exactly! I don't have kids of my own, but I've been trying to learn from my friends who do have kids.<|endoftext|>"
Information,One of my friends who has a really peaceful household maintains a high standard of speaking to her kids like adults and only engaging in conversation when they're speaking respectfully.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information","I really like how she does that - only engaging in respectful conversation and not letting the yelling escalate. I work with kids sometimes, too, and it seems like they all just want to be big kids and be treated that way, too.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's so hard! Who can be a full-time parent and best friend and take care of your own life, too. It sounds like you have the best intentions, and you're working really hard on it.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It can be so hard, so frustrating, and so easy to revert to those habits we both grew up with.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I have a co-worker who has kids with special needs, and she has this great phrase for working with her kids.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"She says, ""is this a small feeling or a big feeling?"" and then, ""Are you having a big reaction, or a small reaction?"", and it really helps her kids self-soothe.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"She's also taught them that if they're being mean to mom (taking something else out on her), they're allowed to say, ""I'm sorry, I'm not acting or feeling my best right now, and I'm going to take a minute to myself."" Do you think your kids might relate to that?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yea, exactly! Trying to teach her kids that it makes more sense for their reactions to be more proportionate to their feelings and to the importance of a situation. It's really helped her address tantrums and help her kids be more self-aware.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",Ahahahah. I believe in you! Just the mom to a kid with autism. She's had to learn a lot of special skills!<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",Happy to be a helpful random stranger to you! Good luck!<|endoftext|>
Others,I'll be thinking of you :).<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I'm Marissa.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry. Can you tell me what happened?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I understand you are upset and caught off guard. What was his reasoning?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Oh wow.... Thats horrible. How long were you with him? Sometimes people can surpise us.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions,Providing Suggestions",Just a bad year all around. I'm so sorry this has happened.. and right before christmas. Hopefully you can return his present if you got him one already. Do you have any plans for christmas? Maybe keeping yourself busy and distracted through the holidays will help.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,YES. At least you found out before such a huge life choice. Its also better you found out now at 2 years instead of 4 years.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I'm sure you are filled with mixed emotions. Anyone would be. Like you said, you dont live with him. So it will be much easier to cut ties.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You are very welcome. I wish you the best of luck. I hope you have a Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Depending on where you are, it might be. May i ask why you are so tired?<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Hello i am sorry for the delay. Is there anything going on to make you so tired?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you gone to a doctor yet and asked for more information about this?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh i am sorry to hear that, are you doing anything now as treatment?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried just talking to a therapist?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Sometimes it can be as simple as not connecting with the right therapist. They are there to support you and if you dont feel the connection its ok to move on to another. Maybe its time to look again? Well, your husband does not control you. You are in control of yourself. It is not his mind and body its set to help. Its yours.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I think that might be an issue you need to deal with first. That is not an ok situation to be in.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,There are many organizations that can help you get out of an abusive relationship.<|endoftext|>
Others,I really hope that you try to reach out to someone for help. Do not let him control your life. I hope you can get some rest.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Oh i know, thats why you need to branch out and find professionals. I know you can.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You as well, thank you for sharing.<|endoftext|>"
Question,When did this fear start?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct?<|endoftext|>
Others,Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Affirmation and Reassurance","Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Just giving it a try is what starts every journey and I am proud of you for taking that leap!<|endoftext|>
Others,No problem I hope all goes well for you and I hope you stay safe.<|endoftext|>
Others,Goodbye!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi there, let me get a deeper understanding of your existing sleep pattern. Do you suffer from insomnia or another type of sleep disorder?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Okay, are you drinking enough water and eating a healthy diet?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I like to analyze my own habits every now and then, it helps me stay in check. You can definitely benefit from meditating and self reflecting.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Of course! I always knock right out after a workout. But if you aren't able to, just simple things like turning all the lights off at the same time every night and laying in bed will help. It will align your circadian rhythm!<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It definitely is a valid reason to be kept awake. The only good part about something so horrible, is that you have the power to make sure you will continue to be a good person. If everyone was as empathetic as you, the world would be a better place. Thank you for caring so deeply about such a brutal matter.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Kindness is contagious, and you definitely have a kind heart. As long as you remain soft in a hard world, people will recognize that and follow suit. The world is becoming more aware, and we have the power to raise future generations with more knowledge and love for one another. Caring doesn't come naturally to many unfortunately, but the ways of inspiring the people that don't care, are endless. We as a society can definitely think of more ways to care for one another.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I worry about my sons and husband and father all the time... I shift my focus on loving them and cherishing every moment we have together. Police or not, the time we have is not promised..<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"A hot cup of tea never hurt too! But in all seriousness, I can completely understand your sleep troubles. It is much deeper than just that. Perspective is the key to life. You are a strong and empathetic soul.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is so beautifully true.<|endoftext|>
Information,"That is good, lavender baths or showers will also ease and relax the troubled mind.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I like to relax with a book and a blanket sometimes too.<|endoftext|>
Information,Self care is definitely something we can overlook accidentally. Being self aware is a daily practice.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"It is good that we spoke today, I am going to hug my sons a little harder when I see them tonight.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hello! How are you tonight?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You think your night is going to have emotional upset? Do you fear you will not be physically safe?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","I'm sorry to hear that. I have struggled to deal with depression most of my life, so I know it can be debilitating, but I have found ways to help myself. Is there a specific problem making you depressed, or life in general?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","I have had trouble sleeping in the past and sometimes I still do, usually if it is when I'm nervous about the future. The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out. I believe medication will help with the symptoms, but it is important to get the root of the problem, why exactly you find it difficult to sleep. Sometimes I take a benydryl because they always make me sleepy, but I usually know why I need to relax, I'm nervous about the next day. So I have found it important to know WHY I don't rest well, if that makes sense to you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I'm also thinking there are a few practical ways you can help yourself sleep. I was advised to get soft sheets, make my sleeping area more restful, make sure the time before bed is relaxing and calming. I also was helped a lot by a Christian Preacher, he's long dead, but he has audio on youtube -- Frank Hammond, Pigs in the Parlor. It's a 5 part series I found helpful, you might want to jot that down.  And I do encourage you to find a counselor, once you rule out the physical (doctor) then you can look at emotional, mental and/or spiritual. I think most of everything is spiritual and emotional to some degree, and our body just responds to that.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure,Others","I will definitely pray for you tonight because I know losing sleep is hard to deal with. But please have hope, sometimes we go through these things to possible get to deeper issues that might need to be dealt with. We only have a few minutes here, but I'm pretty old and I have found this to be true so many times.  Get a good support system of good friends. Having people who ""get"" you is SO vital to our lives. And learning to be grateful helps too. And especially journal, find out what may be bothering you. I had some abuse issues and that is why I had a hard time resting. I also would wake up in the middle of the night and obsess over problems with people. I had a lot to work through, but most nights, I sleep restful now. It may take time. I have hope for you! :D.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Oh, sometimes I would drink Sleepy Time Tea, be kind to yourself. God bless, I'm glad I could encourage you. Sometimes it is really hard to push through difficult times!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thanks you too! We are all blessed when we help each other! Have a great night.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So it's been more difficult for you to remain cheerful since the plandemic?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I actually have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life so I can understand.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure",That doesn't sound helpful at all. I have found a few things I do to keep myself from being to worried and depressed. They help a lot.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","True, many people do not understand depression. I actually have found it easier to find a person who DOES understand and not talk to those who don't. When I talk to those who don't, it brings me down, so I find a good friend I can confide in. I can understand being discouraged to and not knowing who will understand you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I find it important to take care of my physical being first: eat well, drink water, exercise, get fresh air. Don't wear the mask if you can help it. Seeing smiles helps.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","I personally don't know anyone who has died and my nurse friends say it is no worse than the flu. So I try not to worry. What I think about is so critical. I try to pray about what I can't handle, then move on, change my thoughts. Walking is GREAT! This is a lovely time of year too!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"So to recap, find a good friend, get exercise, eat well, talk to people who will try to understand you.  And of course, pray.  The survival rate is 99.996% so the fact that you know no one who died is good news. I had flu like symptoms before this all happened and I still have a cough. They spray the skies too, so I try to not live in fear. There are a lot of consequences to fear, your heart beats faster, you stress yourself out, so it's important to not focus on negativity for too long.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Here is a good saying -- if you want to change your feelings, change your thinking.  Feelings are like the tail on the dog, they follow thoughts. So keep your thoughts positive, cultivate an attitude of gratitude, even write a list of of things you are thankful for.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Self-disclosure","I'm almost 60 and my husband is 66. We refuse to live in fear. These are difficult times, no doubt, but I believe if you take the time to pursue good healthy, you will be better for it, emotionally and mentally and physically. All around! Well, I hope I have encouraged you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"So we are about the same age then! I encourage you to write down the strategy, while the ideas are simple, sometimes they are NOT easy! We must make a choice to do what is healthy! God bless you! Have a good night!<|endoftext|>"
Question,"HI, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Others",Its very sad but try to come out from depression. because its not good for your health.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh!, please don't feel like this try to do some yoga before sleeping.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others",yoga make you feel relax try this. yes try it make you feel better. Yoga is relaxing tool.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Reflection of feelings",try to watch some videos and follow some yoga trainer. Just from your chatting i feel how much you are in depression.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others",Try those things that make you feel happy before work like funny videos. I hope i can help you.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Long time age I'm in same situation so i try those things so those help me to come out from this.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yes its too early try to fix your old relationship before move on new.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Oh! so than i think you need to move on from this.<|endoftext|>
Others,Try do relaxing thing that make you come out from this. Thanks that you share your problem with me.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Your welcome.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Oh no, what happened to make you feel this way?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sure that's terribly frustrating having someone treat you like that. Is this something that your boss is aware of?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Can you discuss it with her in a respectful way to get her to understand that you're not trying to undermine her but that this is how you work most efficiently? And maybe mention that you don't want to involve the boss?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I think sometimes it's easy to jump to anger when you feel hurt. It might be worth telling her how you feel and also maybe ask why she thinks you should be doing things her way. Maybe there's a give and take in this situation. Some of her methods could be beneficial.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings",Tell her the things that you like about her method and maybe suggest some of your methods to her as well. Maybe she'll find them to be more efficient. Make it a partnership rather than a fight for whose method is better. She could feel threatened by you so it's worth digging into those feelings with her and proving to her that you're working toward the same goal.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I'd suggest how much she's helped you since you are in fact the new kid on the block.  And tell her that you want to work with her to have the most efficient partnership possible and use each of your talents to the best of your ability. Then you can lay out how you work best and see where it goes from there.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I'm so glad, these can be frustrating situations but sometimes it's worth looking at the other person's perspective.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Absolutely, I have no emotional stake in this. The two of you do and that can cloud things sometimes.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That's great to hear, I'm glad we were able to chat!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That's great, good luck!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Hi there! How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am fine! Thanks for asking. May I know the reason you are sad, if you'd like to share?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I understand exactly how you feel. My flight tickets were cancelled and my plans to visit my family and friends after 2 years went up in flames!But, this pandemic is never-seen-before event and certain restrictions are unavoidable and life saving.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"All of us are in this together and if you tolerate short term inconveniences (lockdown, masking up, social distancing), long term benefits are multi fold. You want your friends to be around when all of this is over, am I right?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Apologies, I didn't mean to make you sad further by sharing my own sob story! At the end of the day, these restrictions are what keeping me healthy.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"That's great! I believe, in this age of technology and social media frenzy, you are not totally cut off from your friends.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, can you try organizing a virtual get together?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Cool! There are lot of online games that have been invented after the lockdown came into effect. You can try searching them online and playing it with your friends.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,We were missing our colleagues at workplace and we planned an online quiz + dumb charade and it was really enjoyable.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"At this point, only through video call. I am middle aged and even if I can travel and visit friends in person, I will NOT because I may be asymptomatic and possible infect my friends or worse their aged parents.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Affirmation and Reassurance","Sure! At the end of the day, health is wealth. Vaccines are already on their way and this too shall pass. So, hang in there :). That's a great choice. Small steps we take now will ensure great benefits later.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel that you need to be able to relax and unwind once in a while but you can't?<|endoftext|>
Question,Ah that can be a problem. Is this causing problems or tensions within your relationships?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have experienced something similar. I found myself getting short tempered and taking things out on my loved ones.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions",Have you considered any kind of counselling to talk through these feelings? There are some organisations around that will offer help for free. Perhaps honestly talking things through with your partner would really help you both too.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I hear you saying that you are putting your work ahead of everything else in your life, is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Nonetheless, there is no need to make it the entire focus of your life, especially if it is impacting on other aspects of it.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you feel that you have to hit unrealistic goals and meet unrealistic expectations?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I personally sometimes find it difficult not to be too hard on myself. Sometimes I have to remind myself to relax and have fun once in a while.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It has been a very hard year for everyone, I know and I sympathise. Can you think of one specific thing you'd really like to do that might cheer you up?<|endoftext|>"
Others,That sounds like a really fun thing to do! Can you plan one evening soon where you and  your friends will do this and you will promise yourself that you won't cancel in favour of work?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Providing Suggestions",Ah yes that is a big problem. Are restaurants closed where you are? What about getting together with just a couple of friends for a picnic?<|endoftext|>
Others,I think that the important thing is to get out of the office and have some human contact. I do agree that it's a really miserable time of year for it though.<|endoftext|>
Question,I hope I have been able to give you a little perspective on your problems! Is there something else you'd like to talk to me about today?<|endoftext|>
Others,That is very true. Try and remember that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks for talking and have a lovely rest of day!<|endoftext|>
Others,Yes :). You just need to press quit and take the survey :).<|endoftext|>
Question,"No, I'm just a mturk worker but I'm completely willing to talk to you about stuff. Is there anything you had in mind?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Is there someone in your past that weighs on your mind?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Going through a romantic loss can be a lot to process. You will be able to let go some day.<|endoftext|>
Information,It is definitely helpful to reach out. You got people that like you.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",Definitely keep  talking to those people because that's gonna help a ton. Yeah you can trust me :) I think we have a bit more to go.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Take things easy and don't worry too much about it, because things will fall in to place naturally if it is a good fit.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yes I have a few times, and even though it hurts sometimes it is generally worth the risk.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you're worried about your studies? I will try to help if I can. Please tell me all you can.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you finding that things are being made difficult because of the pandemic?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I hear you. I think we're all really suffering at the moment. Are you getting any support?<|endoftext|>
Question,What sort of thing do you want to go into when your studies are over?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That is a really worth profession. Have you thought of doing some volunteer work before you graduate?<|endoftext|>
Question,That is an awesome thing to do though it could be very mentally draining. Do you feel up to it?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Don't put yourself under too much pressure if you are suffering yourself.<|endoftext|>
Information,I think a lot of people who work helping other people have that sort of problem - it's too easy to neglect yourself.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about how you're feeling right now?<|endoftext|>
Question,That sounds wonderful - is it the sort of job you were really looking for?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Don't over extend yourself though. Make sure to give yourself plenty of you time.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe set aside a few hours each week where you do something just for you, even if someone else claims that they need you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Wait till we hit the fifteen minute mark :D. And you're most welcome, have a lovely day!<|endoftext|>"
Question,What changed to bring you to the point you can't stand him?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",That sounds like a really difficult and uncomfortable situation to be in. How long have you been together?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's good you know where you're at and what you do, and do not, want.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions","When ending a relationship, we're not responsible for the other person's emotions. Whatever they feel, they feel, and we can't control that. You need to do what is best for you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You might try talking to him and seeing if he has any awareness of your unhappiness, of you discomfort with his pushing for marriage and children when you're not ready.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"A good friend once told me that all normal, sane people feel guilt when ending a relationship when they're not happy. There is no pleasure in breaking someone's heart, especially when they haven't done anything really wrong.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you're maybe not 100% certain you want to end things. That's where talking to him becomes important.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information","And, if you do have a talk with him and later it becomes clear the relationship still can't work, it won't hit him as such a surprise when you choose to end things. And, if you do have a talk with him and later it becomes clear the relationship still can't work, it won't hit him as such a surprise when you choose to end things. COVID has put a huge strain on a lot of relationships. People are stuck spending way more time together than they are used to, and there's really not much to do about it right now.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think that's a good decision. I hope the two of you are able to come to a better understanding of where things are with your relationship.<|endoftext|>
Others,Good evening.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So just so I understand, the holiday season is making you feel alone and isolated.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anything in particular about the holidays that is bothering  you?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I am also far away from my family for the holidays, so I know how hard that is.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Not at all.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure",Have you thought about setting up some video calls with your family during the holidays? I know a lot of people are doing that so they can feel closer to the family during these tough times/. I have not been able to travel as much due to the virus.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That is tough, but I definitely think setting up a time to chat with her would help a lot!<|endoftext|>"

Question,Hello! How are you feeling at the moment?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am very sorry to hear that - I will help if I can!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Ah that must be very worrying, especially at this pandemic time. What field are you in?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I see. Have you already started looking for new work? It might help you feel more secure.<|endoftext|>
Information,Would you contemplate moving? I hear that there are a lot of opportunities in your field on the East Coast.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I understand - I find it very difficult to meet new people too. Maybe you could join some online groups in  new area before actually moving there?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I find it much easier to meet people online. And you could get familiarised with local amenities too.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Facebook is a good place to meet people I find. There are all sorts of different groups there.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you likely to be in financial difficulty after your job ends or do you have savings as a safety net?<|endoftext|>
Information,Is it legal for them to give you such short notice? You might have grounds for a complaint.<|endoftext|>

"Others,Providing Suggestions",bye! :). (you need to press quit from your end first as I can't here :)).<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like an awful lot to go through in a few years time, which now can feel like the time passes so quickly.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you tried to talk to your therapist through video chat or is that something they offer?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question","That's great that they can offer that, I know it's very difficult to get regular care at the moment with the pandemic. Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Wow, I can't imagine what the car must have looked like then for such a comment to be made. I'm glad that you here and despite going through that trauma that you are still going.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"A women fell asleep at the wheel in 2013 and hit me going through an intersection and totaled by car as well, but I had only had a concussion and pain I had to go to physical therapy for a short time, so I can't imagine how you must have felt.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed.<|endoftext|>
Question,You are 100% correct. Have you looked into any support groups at all or tried to connect with anyone with similar experiences through social media?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Gotcha! Well I'm glad I was able to connect with you this evening because sometimes it helps just to chat and have someone listen :-).<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope that for 2021 things can somewhat go back to normal so the routines can get back to what they were and that this next year is your best year yet. You have already been through so much to be in your 20's.<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am sorry, when did this happen?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I can understand the pain you must feel and the betrayal, that is absolutely awful.<|endoftext|>"
Question,How are your children doing through this?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,What a terrible thing for him to do. I agree with you not to upset them right before Christmas.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That is always a tough one. My suggestion is to not put him in a bad light since they do not have the angry feelings toward him that you do. Maybe tell them that he has made some choices in life that doesn't involve you, and unfortunately, we cannot control people and their feelings.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Exactly, that is a burden that children should never have to endure. They are always the innocent victims in our personal problems.<|endoftext|>"
Information,True! How old are they?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,They should hopefully be young enough not to want details. Maybe if they ask say he didn't give you details because he apparently doesn't know himself what he wants. You sound like a very caring mother who wants the very best for her children.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have a daughter and we have went through something similar in the past so I can relate. The truth is, I have found over time that it is our children who get us through these tough time.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You will get through this and come out ahead in the long run, just stay strong!<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Others,Question","yes i am here, how are you today? what is the problem your having? hello im here thank you. how are you feeling today? whats the prpoblem your having? hello. what are you having problems with?<|endoftext|>"

"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","sorry i was having technical difficutlties, but i did not receive a message regarding what your having issues with. can you tell me again please. im sorry about that, but im here to help you as much as i can.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"so your probelm seems to be that you want to believe she is getting the help for her heroin problem, but you are hesitant becasuse of some of her actions when you see her>.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"thats a tough situation to be in with someone you care about, i went through a similiar situation with one of my parents, so i have somewhat of an idea where your coming from.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Others","are you familiar with anyone else that knows her and her situation and have they shared the same concern? the issue is, suboxone is a narcotic as well, so if shes still getting used to the effects of suboxone, it may seem like shes still using heroin, when in reality shes just struggling getting used to the suboxone. maybe you could sit down with her, and without accusing her in any way, ask her how the new medicine is working for her and questions of the sort in order to get a judge of how she acts and how she answers, that may be able to give you a better idea of how much your suspicions are true or not.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,thats what im here for. im glad i could give you some input today. i hope you can get this figured out and it isnt as it seems.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"that must make it that much harder. just do what you can for her without pushing her away,  and pray to god she keeps herself on the recovery path. addiction is an evil and vindictive dicease, and it holds no boundaries. never give up on her, as its always key for someone struggling with addiction to always have someone they know they can talk to.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"anytime. im glad i could help. have a wonderful day, and ill be sure to throw you and your daughter in my prayers. best of luck to you and god bless.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hi there! How may I support you?<|endoftext|>
Others,I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn't taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It's also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It sounds like you're finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it's the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can't live your life in fear, and that they're going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Reflection of feelings","Can you tell them that that just isn't the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don't want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you're not seeing them.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn't think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I am proud of the choices you are making and I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control. There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes of course, I hope this was helpful. You are doing the best you can and take pride in knowing that. :).<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hello! How's it going? How can I help you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,We all have those days :/ what's bothering you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like your having trouble giving yourself that little push to get the wheels turning. I've totally been there. What do you feel is the reason?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I understand, I've been there before. You just have to take one step at a time and not overwhelm yourself . Have you tried any tools to help you get going?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"What I find that works is to make out a list of all the things you want to accomplish and the possible steps you need to get there. It also helps to let someone know how you feel like a friend or relative, you would be surprised that being open with people can open up new doors in life.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Question","You feel like your friends don't listen or care? And trust me you are not alone. I am going through that as well. I messed up so you can say, but as time went on I realized that I can't live like how I was living anymore and I SLOWLY moved towards my goals. I just graduated phlebotomy school for example. What are your goals?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Thank you! Yeah money is tight these days especially with the pandemic going on. If your business has a good idea there are many venture capitalist that are willing to invest in your idea. You can search for websites and pitch it to them. But don't let anyone stop you, you can do it! Or even search for people in different forums with the same ideas as you, you guys can collaborate and possibly bounce your ideas off each other. There are also loans you can get from the bank. Don't get discouraged. It's never too late.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Check out crowd funding websites. Like go fund me, indi gogo, kick starter, and just giving. No problem! I'm glad I got to help! Please check out those websites especially kick starter because you basically pitch your idea and people invest in real time. Right away. I'm really glad I got to talk to you, you can do it. At least you have goals right?! That's already passed the first step. You got this! I hope everything works out for you.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hello, How are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm sorry to hear that. What has caused it to start?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I understand your feeling of being upset, I would be too. Do you think it may have something to do with the pandemic, or possibly something else?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I'm sorry to hear that. I've dealt with something similar earlier this year myself. I know how you are feeling. Have you tried to reach out to her and let her know how you've felt? I'm sorry to hear that. I've dealt with something similar earlier this year myself. I know how you are feeling. Have you tried to reach out to her and let her know how you've felt?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I see. I would feel the same way if it were in your position. You seem like a person who would go above and beyond for a good friend.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"You do seem like a wonderful person, and anyone who is your friend would be lucky to say so. It does sound like your husband may be right. or even just taking a break for a little bit.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I totally understand that, especially with how long the friendship was. Sometimes just a little time away from eachother works.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I would just distance it, and see if she reaches out in a week or so. if not, I would just reach out and see how everything is going.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome! I hope everything works out for the both of you.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What are you seeking support for today?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you are describing a strong association between the holiday season and loss of loved ones. This leads to less of a desire to engage in typical holiday events. Does that sound right?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I can see why this time of year is difficult for you. Trying to hide depression can be a challenge. Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives. Are there any aspects of the holidays that bring you joy? Maybe holiday music, movies, bright snow (if there is snow where you live), or seeing joy on someone's face when you give them a great gift?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I understand - and it is normal to feel that way. When we lose someone who brought us happiness, it is only natural to miss them and their company.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's great! You must have a special talent for personalizing your gift selections. Perhaps focus on that reaction from you nieces and nephews to support your motivation for giving gifts this year.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Wow, what a great gift idea! That is a solid start on your gifts for the season, and something to be proud of.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","And I see, it sounds like the changes in your life are potentially impacting your daughter as well. However, I'm glad you have each other for support this season. This year has been crazy for many reasons, and many people tend to find comfort in routines or traditions. Do you and your daughters have any holiday traditions you typically complete? Awesome gift idea! Personalized gifts are always so heartfelt and appreciated. Good thinking!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hi there! I am here to chat :) What is on your mind? Hi there! I am here to chat :) What is on your mind?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I'm so sorry to hear that, that is really rough. He sounds like a real jerk if you ask me!<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I get that, it's hard to understand why the people close to us do bad things.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You did nothing wrong. It's something wrong with him, if he did this to you, he'll probably do it again to her. Do you really want to be with someone that disregards your well being like that?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand, it's easy to get sucked back into the nostalgic good memories of when things were at their best.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"It really sucks, doesn't it? And it's not a walk in the park to get over someone when you've been so close to them. Breakups are kind of like a bad cut. They really hurt for a bit, but then a scar eventually forms over it and you start to forget about it.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","Do you have a group of friends, or activities to keep you busy while you're going through this? It helps to keep your mind distracted :). And you are so welcome! I've been through my share of breakups too, it's never fun!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Friends come and they go, it doesn't have to be a game of choosing sides. Keep in touch with those that keep in touch with you. Or maybe reach out to some other friends you haven't connected with in awhile.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Totally! It helps to get into group activities, like hiking to going to the gym, or a book club.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You are welcome! I hope you feel better and have a great night!<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance",I am doing well. That is okay typing can be a bit of a pain. Is there anyway i could convince you to type a little longer so that I may help you? I assure you that your typing skills are above par & I know you will knock it out of the park my friend!<|endoftext|>
Others,Awesome i am glad to have you back!<|endoftext|>
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings",You are very welcome & why do have second thoughts when you type? The only thing that matters is that you made the effort to type reguardless of how well you feel your typing skills are. You should be proud of uourself! I myself use to struggle with typing. Do  you think maybe you are being to hard on yourself?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions","I Think alot of people could relate to how you feel. May i suggest that before you start typing stop, close your eyes, take a deep breath in your nose hold it. then blow it out of your mouth. that should help clear your mind and rid yourself of all those jitters.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Thank you that is very kind of you to say. I have just had alot of practice in dealing with anxiety. I agree the relaxtation music doesnt work for me either. Breathing seems to help me the most. Its natural and I can control it which I really like.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance",Yes we have. I know many people deal with anxiety. It is not uncommon so therefore you are not alone my friend! You are doing great! I am so proud of you!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,How do you feel?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Aw how precious! I am glad i could help you, enjoy the rest of your day my friend!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You're feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics-wise and you're worried you won't be able to succeed. Am I correct?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I know exactly how you're feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think it's great you're taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you'll be able to succeed!<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don't overdo it.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Yes, I struggl.ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Of course! Is anything else on your mind?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you're really trying to help yourself grow.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Self-disclosure","yes, it's true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you're feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I'm just trying to look at the bright side.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, I'd recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything. At the moment, it's all we could do.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,that's great!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"that's amazing, I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease.<|endoftext|>"

Others,"Alright, please reach out if you need to talk again! Thank you so much!<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am not so bad. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Ah I hear you, I have suffered bad anxiety for years. Have you been getting medical help?<|endoftext|>"
Information,Some anti anxiety medication can be addictive but if you're sensible with it you should be okay. Talk to your doctor?<|endoftext|>
Information,What about counselling .. would you consider that? There is some very good therapy available.<|endoftext|>
Question,True - I know different cultures do take different approaches to things and in some places talking about mental health is taboo.<|endoftext|>

Information,Is it not possible to get it free? It is provided free in my country.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ah, you need to move here to the UK ;).<|endoftext|>"
Information,We don't have to worry about the cost of medication or counselling as we have socialised medicine.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Sure. Everyone pays a small percentage of their income - depending on how much they earn - and it goes to fund the NHS. Everyone is therefore eligible for free hospital treatment etc and we pay a standard amount (about ten pounds ie fourteen dollars) for a prescription, no matter which drugs we are gettign. If I needed a heart transplant tomorrow it would be free :D.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Most of Europe do it that way. It works well :).<|endoftext|>
Others,At least you'd be sure you'd be able to get help for your anxiety!<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you're looking for a way to handle these feelings in a healthy way. Am i right in that?<|endoftext|>
Others,That makes sense. Some feelings of sadness around a loss are normal but they can be a problem if they start interfering with functioning. Do you have a support network or someone you can turn to when you feel like this?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you feel like you talk to your spouse about these issues?<|endoftext|>
Information,"From what I have seen, if people try to keep their emotions inside, it can be more damaging in the long run. This isn't something you have handle all by yourself.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"Okay, I understand. Do you feel embarrassed because this is happening to you?<|endoftext|>"

It took some time to work through but thankfully today it is all a distant memory. Sometimes time is the best healer. Be kind to yourself and take time for you.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I hear you on that. It has been a very unusual year in general. I think that with everything going on in the world it is more important than ever that we take me time.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I know how hurtful that can be when people chose sides. It happened in my own divorce. The best thing you can do I think is to remember not to let anyone else's misinformed opinions affect how you ultimately view yourself. None of those people were there and none of them experienced what you did.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I understand, it is a difficult time to meet new people. Even in normal times a divorce is difficult but even more so with the restrictions we have at the moment. I think everything you are feeling is normal. Have you connected with a therapist to help you process all of your feelings. I know that helped me. Many are doing virtual sessions at the moment.<|endoftext|>"
Question,How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Question,What's the occurrence exactly that you are referring to?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Oh wow! I'm so sorry! I can't imagine how you are feeling! Have you found anything to do to keep you busy? Or maybe some good distractions?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Do you think you guys could reconcile your relationship? Is there any hope? Is she willing to work with you and work through her mistakes?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It takes time. Sometimes, the best relationships occur when people work through the most difficult occurrences in their relationship. Have you tried talking to her? I would recommend talking to her when your emotions have settled.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I would make a pros and cons list. If there are a lot of pros, I think it's worth a shot! Just give yourself time to process everything that has happened. You don't want to sit down and talk to her and let all your emotions come out. That could cause more harm. Just make a list and you'll have a better understanding of which direction you should go with your relationship!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Yes. Give it time. Wait to hear her story. Make your pros and cons list. And see where to go from there. Be easy on yourself. It's okay to have hard days. Just give yourself time to heal from the hurt!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I am sure it has! Try to spend time with friends and family that can be there for you during this time. You need to lean on people when things get hard like this!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That's awful! You need better friends than that!! What about your family?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's a great idea! Family can be super helpful for you during this time!! Let me know if I can be  a supporter for you in any other way!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,No problem at all! Sending positive vibes your way!! You can get through this!!<|endoftext|>
Others,No problem! Hope things get better for you!<|endoftext|>
Question,Tell me more about it. What made your day stressed?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm not sure what you mean by that? Can you clarify what you mean by that?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"it seems that you are having a bad day, mostly attributed to the fact that your properties have been auctioned by the bank. Correct me if I'm wrong.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"So, I have also struggled with that in the past. The way that really helped me put things into perspective is to cut off some of the vice you have in your life!<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","I know it's a tough situation, but I know that you can do it. Would recommend seeking conversations with friends or family.<|endoftext|>"

I want to let you know that you are going to make it. There is light at the end of the tunnel and only you can be alter it with your willpower. I believe in you.<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,Sorry to hear that. I feel you because I had an experience about breaking my bones. It was sad story. how you feel right now.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Very good. I am glad that you have a good family who can support you whenever you need a help.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Totally, sad side of our current situation. I hope you can tide-over this hard time soon and you are doing your best at this time. So proud!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Ohhh that sucks. I am happy to yo don't lose your fun and you are not pessimist which is good and it might help for your health. Always try to see the bright side.<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,"ok for sure, It was nice to talk you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,hope you feel better.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything you'd like to open up about today?<|endoftext|>
Others,I am sorry to hear you feel that way - are you talking about anyone specific or just generally?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel that you are being treated as though you are invisible in a family setting?<|endoftext|>
Question,That really sucks. Do you have many friends and contacts outside of the family setting?<|endoftext|>
Question,Yes the pandemic is making everyone feel a bit raw I think. Are you actually seeing your family in person regularly?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Would you consider calling a family conference and telling them how you feel?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Self-disclosure",It's okay I got it :). To be honest I have some experience of being in this position and eventually I had to cut some family members off for my own mental health.<|endoftext|>
Information,There are counsellors available that you could see one to one that might be able to help you be more assertive?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I understand. So this is not an overall issue, just a family one?<|endoftext|>"
Others,I wish you all the best. I hope that things will pick up for you in the near future!<|endoftext|>
Others,Thank you for talking!<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others",(you have to end it your end ... I can't :)). you just have to press quit and then take the survey :). Please can you end the chat? Neither of us will be paid if you do not and it is physically impossible for me to!<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",I am doing well. I've been handling the pandemic surprisingly well given I deal with germaphobia myself. I can't wait for this all to be over. Is there something I can help you with today?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","Yeah, socially distancing is quite the isolating experience so I can relate to how you are feeling. What have you been doing to keep yourself occupied?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",It's good that you are doing your best to take care of yourself. Have you been able to connect with friends or loved ones?<|endoftext|>
Question,It seems like you are doing what you can to stay connected with people. Did something happen that lead you to want to reach out for support?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",It sounds like you were going through a really difficult time. What was going on for you at the start of the pandemic?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can imagine how that would put you in a dark place in your life. Just know that you are not alone in this and that there are resources and opportunities out there.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello! How is life treating you right now?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I see .. so I hear you saying that you are suffering from very bad anxiety?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Ah I have had this problem myself. Have you consulted with your doctor?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am not sure what sort of medications they are - are they specifically for insomnia?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I tried those too but did not find them very effective, did you?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"There are some sleeping pills out there that are not addictive, or at least I believe so.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I think the over the counter things are generally considered safe but you could ask the pharmacist.<|endoftext|>
Question,How old are you?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Ah, I am in my mid forties, everything starts to get harder health wise after that age don't you think?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"And sleeping problems start emerging, sigh. Do you get a chance to nap during the day?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Sounds like you have a very packed life. Maybe you need more time to yourself to relax?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anyone in your home that you can discuss this with? Spouse?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I hear you on that one too :(. I think you are being put under unnecessary stress.<|endoftext|>
Question,What are the chances of you doing something just for y ourself soon? A spa day maybe?<|endoftext|>
Question,"No worries, I have a couple of minutes more to spare if you'd like to talk about something else :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,"No problem at all :) can you just wait for the fifteen minute mark before pressing quit, thanks and have a great day.<|endoftext|>"
Others,It's a living :D.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here.  Why are you so stressed?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question",That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way.  I have been there myself. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend?<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere.  Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with.  However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship....this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn't feel awkward.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",That sounds like a great idea. Have you been dating other people much?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yes the Corona virus has really put a damper on all kinds of normal activities.  Have you thought about joining like a group with similar interests as yourself?  Maybe look for a local group that has a Facebook page and you can  start with building friendships just by chatting online or even on the public page itself.  Some of the best lasting relationships start out as friends with similar interests and then they blossom.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Sounds like a great plan, how are you feeling now?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's great, sometimes just being able to talk through things with someone else, really helps to get things in perspective and brainstorm some new ideas.  I am glad you are feeling better and hope that you have a great rest of your day.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Good Bye.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",What's wrong? How can I help you? I'm doing pretty well.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","That’s a tough situation. I feel for you. Losing a job is hard, but now, with the pandemic, it's especially hard. Do you live by yourself? Is there someone you can talk to?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I hear you. This is tough! It is important to be around other people. Don't isolate yourself.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That's too bad. Is there another person, a family member? By the way, how long had you worked at the job?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's unfair of them.You don't need to discuss the problem. Just chatting with someone can change your mood.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",Six years...That's a long time. I bet you were good at your job. I want to help you.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,The economy really has gotten bad. Many people are in a similar situation. I worry too that I might lose my job.<|endoftext|>
Information,Many people are angry with you. Have they tried to help you with the job search? Do you want to reach out to them for that?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I try to stay positive. I talk to people. I think about after the pandemic and how things will be.<|endoftext|>
Information,Hmm. That's not supportive. Is there an agency in your city that can help you get that kind of info?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Information","That's too bad. Normally I would send them an email, see if you can schedule an online chat. I'm not sure what to do in this case. Have you applied for unemployment?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"That might not be possible at the moment. Work is scarce. I've looked for extra online work, but so many people are trying to get the same work!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That's the next thing for you to do. You might get cash coming in. It will help you stay optimistic.<|endoftext|>
Others,Great! I hope that this chat has been helpful.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You're quite welcome! Best of luck with the job search!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I hope so too.<|endoftext|>
Others,"By the way, you need to press the submit button on your end.<|endoftext|>"
Others,No. The supporter cannot submit. The two buttons to the right of the text box should have an option for you.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I looks like you have hard time in sleeping. Correct me if I am wrong.<|endoftext|>
Others,Are you working late at night? is that the reason you want to sleep at day time.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can totally understand how you feel without proper sleep. Our body need full rest to function well.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Reflection of feelings",As far as I understand that you don't have long sound sleep. May I know your schedule please. Just wanted to know how intense is your work and trying to analyze the reason behind sleeplessness.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Information","When I feel restless and want to sleep well, I take warm shower before sleeping and it helps me. At day time try to keep your bedroom dark so you can sleep for longer. Enough sleep is very important for good health.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Some people put soothing soft music to make them sleep too. Have you ever tried that?<|endoftext|>
Others,Hope it will help you. Do you any any other help?<|endoftext|>
Others,sure! Have a wonderful sleep ahead.<|endoftext|>
Others,Bye! You may submit the test now.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, how are we doing today?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question",I am doing swell. What's on your mind today?<|endoftext|>
Question,How long has this depression been looming over you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am sorry to hear that, you mentioned that you have been getting migraines lately though you have been depressed for a longer duration, lets try to pinpoint that cause first.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Would you say that the migraines are a result of working?<|endoftext|>
Others,"you'd be surprised as how much stress actually does to the mind itself. Has anything in your daily life, in the past month alone, changed that would lead to increased stress that you wouldn't normally experience?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"from where I am, most businesses require us to work form home. Is this true for you?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Ah, I also know some essential workers who must physically attend work. I am lead to believe that the pandemic inadvertently causes a lot of stress in places that we don't commonly associate stress with. For example, wearing a mask everywhere for us in the United States can become a pain sometimes like when I forget it in the car or the house.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","I don't blame you, its impossible to keep this composure especially with a pandemic breathing down our necks. When I worked, I found that smaller problems that wouldn't normally phase me began to have a greater effect when the pandemic hit. Thus my stress went up as a result and wearing a mask didn't help the problem.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hmm I guess we all deal with the precautionary measure differently. Has your daily routine changed at all in the past month?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"are you able to identify any change whatsoever? I ask since any imbalance our body and mind experience is sometimes enough to see a poor reaction, that may lead to things such as migraines.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Glad to know my advice is worth something, afterall I am not a doctor. Nice speaking with you!<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am sorry to hear that but I am happy to listen. What would you like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Okay, well, let's take this one thing at a time. What would you say the main reason you were fired was?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I understand how it feels to feel you are not doing as well as you might. I work in the gig economy and enjoy it but it's not what I'd intended to do with my life.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Hmph that does not sound at all cool but it can hardly be considered your fault.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Restatement or Paraphrasing",It's a very unstable time unfortunately - even highly reputable companies seem to be in trouble. Ah I have heard of that. You do not think that you are good enough?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I hear you. It's a demoralising sector to work in, for sure. What would you like to do, if you had your choice?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I know that :) You seem like a good person. I think that the pandemic has had a negative impact on virtually everyone. It's been a very strange 15 months, for sure.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well, you could still finish it just for your own sake? It would be something worthwhile to look back on later.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I would stay away from twitter .. it 's very toxic.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I don't think I'd even get two paragraphs to be honest. But keep writing it, don't give up.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance",I think people just have more of a platform to vent and feel that they can be hateful because no-one can see them. Anyway it has been nice to talk to you .. I hope I have been able to help you!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"You're very welcome :) Can you press the quit button first, I can't this end :).<|endoftext|>"
Question,oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that. when did you find out?<|endoftext|>
Question,that's a hard way to find out. are you still in the same house?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"i can't imagine what you are going through, but separate spaces sounds like a very good idea to me.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"before you take any action, i'd ask myself what are your options? you know that his actions have very little to do with you and more to do with him, right?<|endoftext|>"
Question,are your parents supportive of that idea?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,it's not about her or you. it's about him.<|endoftext|>
Information,"they will understand. opening up to them will be the hardest part. it's a shame cocktail, but it's not one you made.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"it's in our nature as women to ask ""what did I do?"" but it is never about us or anything we did.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,trust and vunerability is huge in a relationship. i'd look for professional help if you wan tot try and work on it.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"do you have a friend who has been through a similar situation? sometime that helps.also, sharing your burden with someone does NOT add to their burden.<|endoftext|>"
Information,my guess is he felt the same way you are feeling right now.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure",watch the brene brown video on youtube with the cartoon animal about empathy - it should help when looking for friends to rely upon. grrrr. that would make me angry too.<|endoftext|>
Information,"i'm totally into the podcasts ""a slob comes clean"" basically it's about getting your poop in a group.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,that's so hard. imagine how much energy he had to use to keep his lives from colliding. he couldn't find a better use for that energy?!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,yes! LOL but it's been helping me focus my anxiety into being a bit more productive.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,what do you want to hear from her? is there anything she could say that woudl make you feel better? NO!! she's not going to be able to help you unless you need a witness for divorce court.<|endoftext|>
Information,"she likely knew, othewise how would he explain all the time he spent with you to her?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"glad i could help. please stay safe and no matter what you decide to do, you will be fine.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Hey. How are you?<|endoftext|>
Question,Why not?<|endoftext|>
Question,How have you been able to get by?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,If you keep trying things will work out in the end.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Perhaps look for any job for now, even if they wage isn't good, because you have to start with something. You need some work experience.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"it happens that you get rejected, but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe every day or a few times a week, depending on what you feel is necessary.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yeah, anything to take your mind of it :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,Good afternoon.  How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Question,Sounds like you might be having a rough day.  Is there something specific on your mind?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,An uptick in expenses seems to be an issue for a lot of us right now.  Glad to hear you enjoy your job.  Sounds like you are a bit torn about leaving a great company.  Do I understand that right?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can absolutely understand why your situation is difficult.  Have you had a chance to talk with your manager about another opportunity within the company that provides higher compensation?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,That's fantastic that you work for a non-profit.  I've been looking to transition to an opportunity like that sometime in the future.  It must be so fulfilling.  I think asking would be a great first step.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"As a secondary plan, have you had the chance to look at positions with similar non-profits?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Additional stress right now certainly isn't anything anyone needs.  You may want to consider looking at resources online that provide comparable salary information for your position.  That would help with having a conversation with your current employer if you are being paid less than average.  Since they are a non-profit, I'm sure they would want to do everything to help you with your financial situation.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That sounds like a great next step.  Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to chat about?<|endoftext|>
Others,It was my pleasure.  Have a wonderful rest of your day and keep your head high!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It would be fantastic to hear how positive your situation turns out.<|endoftext|>
Question,Good morning. What type of decision is troubling you?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","I can understand the feeling lonely would make you feel your decision was wrong but from an outsiders view, it was not a healthy relationship if he was already committed to someone. You deserve something better. Someone dedicated to you.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",I completely understand. I have been in your shoes before. I learned a lot and found out more about myself in the growing experience after the relationship ended. I'm sure there was some positives even with you at the end of the relationship now. Each person is put in our life for a reason or season. This may just be the stepping stone to finding your soul mate. The perfect relationship won't feel so tricky in the long run and will make you feel on top of the world!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Sounds like you really but your heart in to this and I'm sure it hurts. No need to rush relationship. Falling back in love with yourself is the key first. Finding your inner happiness will make the next relationship that much better and stronger! Treat yourself to a few solo dates to find joy in the day to day life you are now building without him.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions",It can be fun! No decisons on who wants to go where. It is all about you enjoying the moment and your own company! No need to go out if you feel uncomfortable. Find a movie you have been wanting to watch and order some take out! Or do some online shopping while enjoying your favorite dessert or adult beverage!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That is a lot to handle! I am proud of you for that as well! No one ever deserves to be abused. Some solo time to rebuild your independance may do you wonders and give you back your strength and self confidence! Seems like the past year has been emotionally draining.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I think you know yourself better than anyone else and are about to leap in to a new chapter of your life. You received lessons from both the past relationships and can take that forward knowing what you wish for and deserve.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Sometimes talking about why you are feeling is the best way to find closure. Keep the memories of the love and good times but know that in the end you were destined for something so much more. As adults we try so often to find happiness in others. He is a good person for wanting to try to resolve the situation for his family but that does not mean he did not love you or that your relationship was not a bright spot in his life as it was yours. I'm sure he is hurting too.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You deserve peace through this transition. It will take some time but I think you will come out even stronger and happier on the long run. Journaling may be a great outlet for your emotions as well.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I think so! It may also let you heal while building your creativity even more! You seem like a very passionate and loving person.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You are so very welcome! You were a pleasure to talk to and I wish you all the best! Let this year be YOUR year!<|endoftext|>
Information,"Hello, how are you today.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,What about giving a presentation gave you stress?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Have you taken steps to help you overcome this fear, such as rehearsing in front of the mirror or in front of another person?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand giving presentations is nervewrecking, but at least you are trying. Are you allowed to take a few notecards just in case?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can definitely relate. It is best to look past the audience and just focus on an object close by. Everyone of us have had to experience this. You are not alone.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Before you go on, try taking a few deep breaths.  Why not try meditating a few days before?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Try shifting the focus on what could go wrong, to what could go right? Focus on others congratulating you on a job well done.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, in the term ""fake it until you make it."" I keep on thinking of what could go right, or in my favor, and when I am done, it actually went okay, and any ""fears"" i had, never came to fruition.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"That's understandable. But now that you're aware, you have the steps the move forward and be successful.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I believe you can do it.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,HOpe you ace your presentation.<|endoftext|>
Question,can you clarify what you mean? did you lose your job?<|endoftext|>
Question,i see. what type of work did you do?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,oh i'm very sorry to hear that. but the great thing about having worked in a kitchen is that there are a lot of skills you can use in other jobs.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"i understand that losing a job sucks and i can sense your frustration at the situation but there are other opportunities out there, and you don't need to be thinking only in the culinary field.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"time management, resourcefulness, being able to think on your feet and manage multiple things at once are skills i'm sure you use and developed in the kitchen, and those are skills you can take anywhere.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"don't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure there are a lot of things you can do. of course if you want to stay in the culinary field, you might need to get creative in the short term. have you thought about finding opportunities to be a private chef? or maybe even make pre-made meals to sell for people who don't want to or dont have time to cook for themselves? another thing you might try is an online cooking lesson or something. with more people staying home and eating in, they might be interested in learning how to cook better food for themselves.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"that sounds like an opportunity in itself to me. i'm sure there are tons of people out there that have the business stuff but don't have the cooking skills. you could find a partner to help, and that way you won't have to do everything alone.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Affirmation and Reassurance","i totally get it, but especially now, there are a lot of opportunities for people who like to keep to themselves, since so many businesses are being forced to go online. you could put an ad on craigslist or facebook for people who might be interested. give yourself a little more credit. you put yourself out there enough to come on here for advice. that's pretty good self-awareness and more than i can say for some other people i know.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"you're very welcome, i'm happy to help and glad you feel better! Best of luck to you!<|endoftext|>"
Others,lol you too ;).<|endoftext|>
Question,How are you tonight?<|endoftext|>
Question,How can I help you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What types of things was she texting him about?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Just from the few messages we have sent, I can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I completely understand this as I had issues with my ex fiancé texting other guys and cheating on me.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know how hard a situation like this is, but I know you can get through it!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried to have a conversation with her about it?<|endoftext|>
Question,What if she doesn't know you caught her?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I think it would definitely help to talk to her about it, it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I can definitely understand the awkwardness of the conversation, it was tough for me to have that conversation as well.<|endoftext|>"
Others,It is definitely not healthy.<|endoftext|>
Question,They are very tough. Did you need anything else from me tonight?<|endoftext|>
Others,You are very welcome!<|endoftext|>
Question,Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today?<|endoftext|>
Question,And what do you mean by microcheating?<|endoftext|>
Information,"Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Well, if you are not talking to them then i see no harm. If you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions",To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best.<|endoftext|>
Question,"I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Then i 100% back you on your decision. Id take this time to focus on you too. Strengthen the bond a bit.<|endoftext|>
Others,I thank you for opening up!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I really wouldnt even consider it cheating to have feelings. Acting on them or trying to strengthen them may be though.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I see that, have you tried to talk to your friends about this issue? Or even try a therapist? Maybe you and your Fiance can figure out more times to talk with facetime or zoom. Do a virtual date night.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I hope you do as well!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi! Hope you are doing well today. How may I assist you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems you are badly hurt by your friend's action. Correct me if I am wrong.<|endoftext|>
Others,So What's bother you a lot ? What happened which leads you to feel like this?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is really bad. It must be hard for you to trust on them.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,How do you come to know that they are talking behind your back? you should talk to them and ask what is the cause that they can't directly talk to you. If something bothers you you should directly talk to that person. Sometime it gives a clear picture.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can imagine how stressed or shocking it would be for you. It is really hard to count on such friends now.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Once one of my friends lied to me. I wanted to breakup with her. Before that I decided to clear the things that why she did that. Motive behind her lying was not bad. I forgave her and we are still best friends. So you should clarify the things or give them one chance.<|endoftext|>
Others,leaving is really easy but having good friends are hard to find. Think about the time when you made wonderful memories.<|endoftext|>
Others,Talk to them. They might feel guilty or in future they won't do that. Sometime we indulge in a conversation which starts with fun and later take the drastic turn. It might happen in your case.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi! How can I help you today ?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It looks like you are missing your friends a a lot.  am I right?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am missing my friends and family too. Due to COVID it's hard for all of us to meet our near and dear. I can totally understand your feeling.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I do video call. It makes me feel that they are very close to me.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can feel how much you are missing them especially in holidays.  engaging yourself in doing the stuff  which you love can be a good idea.<|endoftext|>
Information,Sadness can lead us to frustration. To avoid that we have to  stay motivated and keep doing something which takes those negative thoughts away.<|endoftext|>
Others,you can play online games with your friends.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"giving task or challenges to each other,  making funny videos, having competition for cleaning room are few example which can be tried.<|endoftext|>"
Others,giving task is my favorite :).<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Telling friend to drink 4 glass of water at once, making bed in 30 seconds, finding particular content on laptop in specific time(30 sec or45 sec).<|endoftext|>"
Others,No problem! Is there anything  else that I can help you with.<|endoftext|>
Others,Thanks! Have a wonderful time !<|endoftext|>
Question,I know sometimes it can be difficult to make decisions. What dilemma are you facing today?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I too, have been in your place. There were days I would just stare blankly without being productive. However, I tried meditating which helped me improve my focus.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I am glad you asked. At first, it can seem a little difficult. But the key is to start small and build as you go. For example, allocating 10 minutes after lunch or borrowing some time off of social media.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"From what I know, you can try to relax before making any decision. I usually follow my intuition and decide. I deal with the outcome later. But meditating has really helped me avoid anxiety.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds as if you are low on self-confidence and are afraid about unfavourable outcomes. Please correct me if I am wrong.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can feel your anxiety just through this chat conversation.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"In my experience, even if we were to fail, we are bestowed with a valuable life lesson which we can use in future decisions.  Approaching the problem with positive mindset will help a lot! Is that something you'd be willing to try?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"That's true. However, research shows that any habit can be broken or formed if you put your mind to it everyday for 5-10 minutes for 3 continuous weeks. Perhaps, replacing your negative thoughts with happy ones might help.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Awesome. I am glad I was able to get you started towards a positive mentality. Is there anything else that I can assist you with today?<|endoftext|>
Others,You're welcome! Have a wonderful week ahead!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Good thanks, so what's troubling you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Responsibility in regards to what?  Like in what area of life do you mean?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hmm, has he been looking for work, or just laying around playing video games and shit like that?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Well, I suppose it's possible that he's been earnestly looking and just not having any luck.  Is he kind of a loser in general, or is he a stand-up guy?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Ok, so it sounds like you're kind of fed up with him in general, and not having a job is maybe just a part of the bigger issue?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well,  it sounds like you're both in kind of a transitional period in life.  It's pretty normal for relationships to not necessarily survive through things like this.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Yeah, I mean it's never easy going through a breakup, but people change as they get older and mature, and they aren't necessarily going to still be compatible the whole time.   Also I think it's important to not think of a relationship that peters out as a failed one.   Just because it didn't last until one of you died doesn't mean it wasn't a success.   I think people put too much emphasis on permanence.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Well I've got a couple decades on you, so I've been through this a few times before.   Actually I'm still friends with pretty much all of my exes.   I mean just because I'm not romantically involved with them anymore doesn't mean that they aren't still terrific people.   Hell, I hung out with two of them just today.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"You bet.   So what do you think you'll do from here?   I mean do you know you want to move on for sure, or do you think you'll see if you can work through this patch?  I don't know that there's a wrong answer .<|endoftext|>"
Question,What kind of issues do you think you are having?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is ""bad news""?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact. For example, if money is the problem for your parents, you can set some rules. LIke you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If you want a better communication, I believe in person will be best.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I apologize and I do agree it is sometimes difficult. Perhaps it will be better to talk to them with another  person present.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"If another person is present, it may make it easier. However, I believe it should be someone that is not invovled in this issue. Perhaps another family member or a close family friend.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Parents have a difficult time understanding their child at times. Hopefully, through this you all can become closer.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others",I personally understand how difficult this can be. But if this works out. You can have a good family relationship and maintain a good relationship with your girlfriend. Best of luck!<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear this. Is there something specifically bothering you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You don't think people like you or care about you at work? What specifically have they done to make you think this?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can understand that might make you feel uncomfortable.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","I have been in many work situations and even social situations where I did not feel as if I fit in, I'm rather an unusual person. I had to learn to not focus so much on BEING accepted. I had to learn what God think of me (he loves me) and try to be kind to all I meet, other centered. That is, I also had to make sure I wasn't being rude or mean. I can understand how hurtful that is. Our society isn't as kind as it once was. I find very few people appreciate kindness. However, I can't get caught up in that, it's the way people are. It isn't a reflection of myself. I think it is the hardest thing to be more concerned with others than we are with ourselves, it can be lonely.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think you can be kind to them, but I think perhaps your expectations are that they reciprocate, and they aren't which hurts. Perhaps be kind without expecting anything in return, and know that God sees your kindness.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings,Others","I also had this happen, I had no friends and at first I thought it was me, then I realized it was an opportunity for personal growth. Which wasn't easy. How do you feel they take advantage? Being ignored is one thing, having someone take advantage of you is a different story.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I understand. Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes.  Because if we say yes because we CAN'T say no, then we feel resentful. So If I can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense.  Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions,Providing Suggestions","If I always say yes, because I can't say no, I feel obligated and resentful, when really, it's me with the problem, I had a hard time saying no because I didn't want to hurt people. Now, I  do the right thing in my heart, if I want to help, I help, if I want to say no, I say no even if it is hard, I don't care if they get upset. I can say no, that's true freedom. I don't advise treating people the way they treat you though. I would remain a kind person. Be the person you are no matter what type of person they are. You have to stand before God one day. If they are ugly, that's on them. But you want to be a kind person. That's the right thing, and you CAN be kind and say no. Those two are fine together! :D. I suggest a book called ""Bounderies"" one of the authors is Townsend -- great book.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Might be on youtube too. Good stuff on how to say no and set boundaries! :D. I think you have identified your problem and looked at it and you seem intelligent and caring! I'm sure you will be able to figure this out. You seem like a  nice person to me, and I just met you. You seem emotionally mature, able to discuss your problems and think about it in a mature way. A lot of people will just blame others and not change. We can't change others, we can only change ourselves. That's the hard part but recognizing we can change and must is so important!<|endoftext|>"
Others,You are welcome! Have a nice evening!<|endoftext|>
Question,I am sorry to hear that. Do you want to tell me about it?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I see. Can you be more specific? A lot of people are insecure about their looks you know.<|endoftext|>
Question,How old are you if you don't mind my asking? This is a common thing among young people.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I see. Well can you tell me what specific part of  your appearance do you hate? Maybe it could be altered?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Well, I have been overweight and I know it sucks. Perhaps you could join a weight loss group?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Well you should be proud of the progress! Maybe buy yourself some new clothes?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Or have a new haircut or something :).<|endoftext|>
Question,Is it just your weight that bothers you about your appearance?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I have a feeling that other people do not feel that way about you :).<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think a lot of people do see themselves in a much worse light as others see them :) It's a human thing.<|endoftext|>
Question,"So, what sort of clothes do you think you are going to buy? :).<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Sounds like a great idea. I bought a fantastic maxi dress recently. Very flattering for those of us carrying an extra pound or two.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I like a nice facemask and a bubble bath, do you?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That is a good thing to do .. great for the self esteem. Maybe buy some new jewellery too?<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others,Question",For sure! It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders! I am in the US yes. Do you have hopes of pursuing ministry at some point?<|endoftext|>

Perhaps searching specific colleges in your state or areas of interest may help.  Also, career websites or job sites may help explore ideas as well as civil service career options.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm glad that you were able to get some ideas to try  and wish you well on your search.  Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?<|endoftext|>

Question,"If you tell me what's going on, I will be more than glad to help.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","The pandemic can definetely be a key factor here. When it first started, I remember feeling lost and unsure about things that I would normally would have no problem with. If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Do you have any family, girlfriend, boyfriend, children?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions","Not seeing your closed ones or simply being apart from them can be more than enough to make us feel depressed or blue. Have you tried doing videocalls with them, for example?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I understand. However, there is nothing wrong with telling them that you are sad because you miss them. Something as simple as getting it off your chest can already make you feel better.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Totally, but remember than they are there for you whenever you need them.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I bet something as simple as ""Hey babe, I really miss you. I can't be glad with your abscence"" could make your boyfriend feel loved while at the same time relieving you.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"That might be why you were unsure about telling them. Believe me, there is nothing wrong with showing vulnerability. We are all vulnerable in one way or another.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Hey, if he is the right one for you, he will completeley accept you as you are and love you. In the unlikely event that he ""rejects"" you for being ""vulnerable"", he wasn't even worth it in the first place. You deserve someone that appreciates you as much as you appreciate them :3.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I believe in you!<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,Your anxiety might come from the pandemic. a lot of people have this problem.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,You may exchange information with your colleagues and see if there is anything you don't know.<|endoftext|>
Information,No. I never had such an experience.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,The best strategy is to find another place. I don't have the intention to play with the office politics.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello! I am here to help, could you please tell me what the issue is?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","I can see why you feel anxious, I would be too given the situation. When did your mother in law got sick with COVID?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Cancer is already a hard enough disease to fight against. My aunt is a cancer survivor. I am sure your mother can make it too.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"From my knowledge, people usually recover from COVID after 2 to 3 weeks, you might consider having a doctor see your mother if she is still struggling.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Others","There are substantially more people recovering from covid each day despite the number of infected growing exponentially. I am sure that, with the proper care, your mother in law will make it, and so will your husband. I am sure he will be able to find a new job soon as new business start to open, even if it's a temporary one.<|endoftext|>"

Others,"I am glad I can make your day just a little better, that's what we are here for ^_^.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"And I am glad you are someone easy to talk to! Some of my patients do not argument at all and expect me to end the conversation when I, as a therapist, have to make sure they are good to go! Helping you has been a pleasure!<|endoftext|>"

Question,"I'm so sorry to hear that, but I would love to help. What is going on?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question","I am so sorry to hear that. breakups are definitely hard to go through, especially in the times we are in right now. How long were you guys together? And you were living together?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Oh I see that was a very long relationship! I actually just got out of a 3 1/2 year one myself, so I understand how hard it is. Are you still currently staying with him until you find your own place? Or are you staying somewhere else?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm glad to hear that you are with a friend right now during this hard time, and that you have a place to go! But I see the struggle is finding a way to get there.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If you are struggling on finding a way back to your moms house, it might be a good idea to loan or borrow some money from either friends or family, or open a credit card just for the time being. Then once you get back to your mom's, you can start focusing on yourself and get yourself back on your feet! IT's important to not overwhelm yourself right now, so focus on one thing at a time.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","That is great to hear! I know that you are probably also hurting from the breakup itself too, but I'm glad to hear that you are focusing on getting yourself to a safe place first. It's going to take a long time to fully heal again, but as long as you make sure you are stable, you will be able to get through this. It also sounds like you know what you need to do, and you aren't letting yourself forget what is important. That is wonderful.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yeah that's great. I have confidence that you will get over this bump in your life, and good things will come to you. Keep focusing on what you need to do! You are doing great!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Oh I am so sorry! Dealing with bereavement is hard at any time but at this time of year I think that it is even worse.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,So you feel as though you have to avoid people because you do not want to make them feel bad that you are feeling bad?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Well let me ask you - if the situation were reversed, would you feel that a close friend was bringing you down if they talked about their bereavement?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I am really sorry about that - that is a seriously rough thing to have had to deal with. Do you have siblings and if so could you perhaps talk with them?<|endoftext|>
Information,What about some sort of professional therapy? There are some organisations out there that will provide a certain number of sessions for free.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Have you tried searching online? I have personally found some useful groups that have helped me deal with the mental health issues that I have.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others","There are plenty available online where you would not need to see anyone in person. Try googling for support groups in your local area? I'd really recommend doing that, it could help you a lot! I wish you all the best and hope that 2021 is a better year for you.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That is tough ... so you are feeling uprooted as well as bereaved? I can only hope things go well for you.<|endoftext|>

Information,would you like to tell me more about it?<|endoftext|>
Question,Why do you feel you can't turn to your friend?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I am sorry to hear that sounds like she sure could use some help as well. Have you tried first taking about her issues and then telling her about yours?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am sorry to her that, so it sounds like you feel you need to give her help but you dont get any from her. But is also sounds like she might not be aware of you needing help.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I think you need to try to tell her about your problems, and maybe even if she feels like she is helping you she is more inclined to help herself some too?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I know, it would be nice of her to ask how are you? But maybe she thinks you are a very strong person that does not need help since you do not voice it.?<|endoftext|>"
Information,Yes the feeling that you help someone can be uplifting and good for anyones ego.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would try to find a conversation and then tell her like sometimes I could use help with whatever and then tell her that you feel lonely and need her sometimes as well.<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,So you feel let down by the Universe and everything?<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"Well, I think you should try it and see. Hopefully it will work for everyone.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",Yes. It is quite scary for all of us at the moment. Maybe it will be under control by this time next year though. Can you think of anything to do that would take your mind off things?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you could make a list of the things that you have to look forward to in the New Year? It might help reassure you that things can get better.<|endoftext|>
Others,Please try not to think like that! I think we will survive. I must go but Merry Christmas !<|endoftext|>
"Others,Information",bye! You need to end from your side .. I can't.<|endoftext|>

Question,Are you someone who has immune issues?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Just to clarify, you are extremely anxious about the pandemic and the affect it may have on you because of your weakened immune system.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Just from the few messages we have exchanged, I can tell it makes you very anxious.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you reached out to support groups for people with auto-immune issues? it is often helpful to speak with people who are experiencing the same issues you are.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you talked to him about the way he reacts to your immune issues? Sometimes people don't realize they are not being helpful and they think they are doing good when they aren't.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you asked what his feelings are towards it? Maybe he is afraid and worried about your health and he isn't sure how to express it and sometimes it comes off as uninterested.<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you been able to talk to your kids about this as well?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Yea, with young kids it is hard to tell sometimes. I know this is extremely hard, but I know you can make it through this!<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure","Ouch! I'm so sorry to hear that. I never lost a dog, but I've lost cats. Is 14 a good age for a dog? I have my first dog so I don't know much, he is 9 years old and came with our house.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm so sorry, losing a pet is very hard on us.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","Was that your only pet? Or do you have others? We moved from FL to KY and the little dog just hung out here, he really belonged to the neighbor's son who didn't want him, so he just ran around wild and wouldn't leave. I never had a dog, but it got cold, so i took him in. They never asked about him and after a week, I asked them if I could have the dog, so they said yes. I don't think they cared. I wish I could give you a hug, really, there are no words to make this better as you already know the grief of losing a pet, it does get better, but it stings terribly at first.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","So you definitely are a dog lover! I was in my 50s before I ever had a dog, now I wish I had more, they are really loving. Not like cats who don't care much about much except FOOD! lol. I know when tragedy happens, I can't get stuck in depression, I sort of have to force myself to put one foot in front of the other. It's hard to have a healthy balance between grieving and continuing to live. Cry, then dry my eyes, pick up, go for a walk, don't get caught in grief, but yet don't deny it!<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","I get stuck too. But you are doing the right things, here you reached out to someone and I do care, so you are moving forward. I always find it helpful just so have someone share my pain with me. Just to know I'm  not alone.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","I do understand. My mom died in 2010, right after she died, 1 of my cats died, my husband went into the hospital and almost died, so we went on vacation so I would not be consumed with grief, and do you know, we brought our pets and our cat died when we arrived here on vacation?  I will never forget that. You know what. I knew I could either get consumed in grief, or push through. Man, that was hard. I prayed a lot and God got me through that and I had a good vacation, all things considered. I will definitely pray for you too that God will comfort your heart and that you will be comforted by your other dogs and your boyfriend's dogs and that you will feel joy at times at the happy memories you had with your dog.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Prayer is what gets me through every day!  :D  It was rough, but I believe these hard times strengthen us in some way. Because life throws hard balls, and we have to move forward or be consumed.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I'm so glad I did too. It was a pleasure to meet you. And once again, (hug). :D.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I have one more thing to say - wise words from this 92 year old lady at church named Sue. She told me this after my brother died. When you get older, everyone you know is practically dead.  She said ""Life is for the living, if you get caught up to much in all the death, you won't life.""  True words. God bless, have a good night.<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Oh I am so sorry to hear that. I cannot imagine how hard that must have been for you.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,He was killed so soon after you last saw him?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you considered any sort of bereavement counselling? Addiction in a partner is a very hard thing to have to deal with. It is not your fault!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Do you feel any sort of guilt about it? You should not, of course, but do you wonder if things would have been different if you had talked to him first?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I have previously had counselling and found it very useful but there is a long waiting list for a free counsellor.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you still in touch with his family and friends?<|endoftext|>
Others,I think you should do things in your own time but I would recommend doing it again one day.<|endoftext|>
Others,Sounds like a very complicated set up. It is sad when family members become partially estranged from one another.<|endoftext|>
Others,That is extremely offensive and I think you would have had the right to contest that.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I hope that you are able to come to terms with things in the near future. Please try and focus on your girls and not worry so much!<|endoftext|>
Others,I think you should talk to someone about this. Maybe a lawyer? There must be something people can do to help.<|endoftext|>
Others,I have to wrap this up now but I wish you all the very best for the future. Please try and reach out to people for help!<|endoftext|>
Others,You are very welcome!<|endoftext|>
Others,"And you too, goodnight. You can leave now :) I will just wait around till you've gone.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Good evening ! How are you on this cold fall night.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question,Question,Others,Question",I can understand how stressful this could be for you! I would feel taken advantage of too. Have you asked them when they thought they could pay you. Have you asked them when they thought they could pay you. sorry I am not sure why it typed twice. Have your friends ever borrowed money before?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I would be furious too!<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",I just meant if they had borrowed in past and returned it than maybe they were telling the truth but since you saw them blowing money that s rightfully yours is a problem. Can you talk to a mutual friend of both of you or if you are close maybe their family ?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",I understand and have been in your shoes and its NO FUN and they don't get to borrow ever again. Have you explained just how much of an issue it is to them and flat out tell them you saw them spending money on junk etc when they could have given to you . Something is better than nothing . Maybe work out a plan of 50 a week if they work?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,And depending on how much of a  friend they are you need to see if this is worth losing friendship over. I mean if you are great friends I d lay low and never let them borrow again. IF you only knew them a short while and felt sorry for them and lent them money than I D talk to parents or someone.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",Id be like I helped you when you needed xxx to do get buyxxx . Now its becoming an issue and I can't pay my bills.  I wanted to help you now can you please give me cash of xxx for xxx starting next friday. Yes friends are hard to come by and you certainly don't need anyone to ever take advantage of you.   But the other side is do you want this person to be your friend if you can't trust them and they are showing you no disrespect or attempt to pay you back?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Awesome!  Good luck! If that doesn't work we can chat again and try something else. Keep safe and Keep the faith .  Personally I would recommend praying if you believe as I do!!!<|endoftext|>
Others,Ok . Good luck.<|endoftext|>
Question,Why do you believe you will loose your job?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"This Covid crisis has been effecting so many lives, I totally understand,.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I have been holding on and trying to see the positivity daily. I practice gratitude to show I appreciate what I do have.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you thought about talking to your boss?<|endoftext|>
Question,"i'm sorry , why were you not able to talk?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I sometimes get nervous when I have to speak up about something that is important to me, can you relate?<|endoftext|>"
Question,You will feel like you will loose your job if you speak up?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Honestly, I can see that being concerning for you.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,Support is needed in this new times!<|endoftext|>
Others,Have a great day.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I can see how you have a lot on your plate. Yo must get very exhausted. Are you wanting to run away alone or move away on your own? Do you feel trapped when you say you want a new life?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Wow, that is a lot of pressure that you have to endure. Do you feel like you have anyone in your life who cares and listens?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am really thankful that you reached out today and I am happy that you are here with me today. You are making a lot of sense and I appreciate you opening up.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Have you been able to tell any friends how you are feeling and how alone you feel?<|endoftext|>
Others,I can understand how you feel. I live in a new town and dont have any friends here and it can be very lonely and isolating. Do you have any hobbies or do you have any time for yourself?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have felt that way before and I reached out for help like you are today. I was so depressed that I need to start therapy.<|endoftext|>
Information,Do you ever write in a journal or are you able to exercise alone? Both of those can begin a path to healing.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I can relate to that. Maybe you can start with journaling and writing out your feelings and thoughts. They may help clear your mind especially in the evenings.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It can even be just a few bullets points to start yuor journal. Just think of it as highlighting your day and write a few bullets of what you are thankful for. That can be a five minute task. I will change your head space.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Yes, you deserve some time to be selfish and take care of you and your needs. You can do it in the evenings when hopefully everyone is asleep and you can rest your mind and reset your thinking.<|endoftext|>"
Information,You have already made great progress today by reaching out and explaining out you feel. Thank you for letting me listen today.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am sorry to hear that youre feeling depressed, do you want to say whats going on?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Sorry to hear, if you dont mind me asking, Why did the break up happen?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I have been there myself with a cheating spouse, I know it is rough, especially so close to when it happened. I can assure you it does get better though.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think the best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from her. It sounds like she is acting toxic and you do not need that right now. I am happy to help and talk with you, but might i suggest going to a local therapist or counselor?<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions","It will take time, the best way to let it not control you is by talking about it. You gain control over it that way. Being betrayed by someone you love is one of the biggest heart breaks there is. You have to focus on yourself and healing that wound.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,It will not be a quick process that i can heal right now. The best way to get out of it is to see a professional. There are many out there that work on a sliding scale or even free. They will help guide you back to yourself.<|endoftext|>
Information,Yes do you have any specific goals right now? or even hobbies you are working on?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I know its tough out there for that as well. I had gotten furloughed but i didnt let pride get in the way and took what i could find for now. Have you worked on your resume or updated it?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others",I worked in restaurants all my life. Its tough but rewarding. Have you looked into moving up from a supervisor? Maybe talk with your boss? Hello are you there?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Well you have the real world experience which is good. Have you thought about doing some classes at a local community college to help with that?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is great news! See we already got your mind off your girlfriend. You'll be back on your feet stronger than ever soon.<|endoftext|>

Question,When did this start?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you had a life-changing diagnosis last year. How has it affected your life?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","I know getting ""lit"" is an easy way to deal with our problems, but it is not always the healthiest thing to do. It sounds like you are trying to escape something.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information","Life can be really hard, but I know you can turn things around! From what I have heard, I think that it could be helpful to try and cut back on the ""getting lit"".<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Do you have any close friends or family that you can talk to?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","I think that's great that you have a girlfriend whom you can talk to! Stronger medication can certainly help, I would recommend seeing your doctor asap.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Wow that is horrible, and you don't sound redundant at all.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I understand that loss is a painful thing to go through and can take us a while to learn to cope with it. I take it you two were close?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I completely understand that. It is important to be able to let yourself heal.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Don't beat yourself up over things that we can't control. What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I think that you need to understand that  things happen about of our control and to not just accept it and forget it, but maybe put a day aside every year to celebrate her life.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"My grandmother was amazing, and loved burritos, so we used to make them together. After she passed, we started making them as a family in order to celebrate the life she had and memories of her.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,That can be tough can  you tell me what the argument was about?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So, why do you think they think that?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I can see why you would be upset about that. So, that is the only reason they don't approve. At this point when they are not as upset you may want to share all the reason she a great girlfriend. If it is based totally on race not sure you can change their minds.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I completely understand that and if you really like her and they see how happy she makes you maybe they will come around.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I would be upset too so, it's understandable.  Just reassure them you love them and your happy and hopefully one day they will be happy with your decesion. If not then it is your decesion who you date and I think they know that too.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",Yes  I have and my parents did not approve either. Eventually my parents came around and most likely yours will too.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,It was in highschool I dated a black man after I became an adult they didn't say much about who I dated and I countinued to date the person and it ended when he went in the miltary and I went to college not at first but it was the distance thing.<|endoftext|>
Others,Most likely they will if she makes you happy they will see that :-).<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Glad that I could be and good luck to you.<|endoftext|>
Question,I have been feeling a little low too. Would you like to tell me a bit about why you are disgusted with yourself?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Ah yes, this has been especially obvious during the pandemic hasn't it? Too many people not following the social distancing rules.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Do you feel that the pandemic has made you feel worse? Or have you felt like this for a long time?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well, it is a pretty significant issue this year :). Re obesity, have you considered doing something to raise awareness?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,So you feel as though there is no bright side - that everything is just artificial and superficial?<|endoftext|>
Others,I don't mean to sound twee but there are things out there in life that can be appreciated for free :).<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I know what you mean about that. I know plenty of people who spend too much of their life working every hour and it leaves them no time to appreciate their money!<|endoftext|>
Others,"People like that are irritating, certainly. I am not sure what the solution is, other than to ignore them.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Well, the fact that you can reflect on it indicates to me that you are probably not guilty. Most of those who do this are totally unaware. It has been really nice chatting to you and I hope that things go your way in 2021. You seem like  good person :).<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Information",you too :). you need to finish from your end .. I can't :).<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi there! My name is Rob, how are you today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Of course! What is the problem?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So to make sure I understand, have you caught your partner cheating?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Has someone told you they suspect he is cheating?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It is a horrible feeling when that seed has been planted in your head.<|endoftext|>
Question,"I know you mentioned you want to believe him when he denies it, I guess the important question is what is making you have that shadow of doubt? Has he been unfaithful in the past?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"And know I am not saying I don't believe you, I think your feelings are valid, and I just want to get the full picture.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Ok. So there has been a past history of this.<|endoftext|>
Question,And what are your friends and family saying to you? Are their accusations valid?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I know for me, sometimes friends and family will say things like this is they personally do not like the partner themselves without taking your feelings into consideration.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Ok I see. And for yourself, do you see a future with him? Because in the end it matters how you feel. Do you feel taken advantage of?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,So possible cheating aside - there is definitely some others issues that needs solving. Have you calmly confronted him saying that he is affecting your personal financial goals?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I think you may have answered your own question. I know it is hard, but if someone shows a pattern and they do not change their behaviour, most likely they will not anytime soon. Meanwhile, your mental health and finances will suffer. If you want my unprofessional opinion, I think your friends and family care for you, and they will be there to help you through this.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Im sorry to hear you have been feeling anxious. Lets work to find things that maybe help you feel better when your feeling this way.<|endoftext|>
Information,Based on studies generally walking away for a moment from a stressor can help to relieve that stressor momentarily enough to maybe make you feel alittle better.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Thats a good idea and sometimes when ive been stressed walking or any physical activity can help to promote more of a positive feeling based on the release of endorphines. How long have you been experiencing anxiety?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you think maybe it has to do with covid going on right now? Or did anythign specifically happen that has brought on more anxiety? more work? family? money? .....<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Generally to relax i as well enjoy some forms of exercise, sometimes a cup of warm tea or even just listening to music can help distract your mind for a moment.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Im so sorry to hear that. I completely understand why you may be feeling the way you do.<|endoftext|>
Information,"I do think a good diet can help with many aspects of things, after all food is the energy and nutrients for your body. So if you eat bad quality food you dont reap all the benefits and nutrition that comes from a good nutrient rich diet.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"The best advice i can give is to remember to be positive , focus on also your own sanity and take one day at a time.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"i think having a good support system is a wonderful idea. That can include friends, family or any other professional you may use to communicate with.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I think that may be so. Its tough to not worry when it comes to anyone you care about or love especially if they arent doing well. Is there anything else i can help you with or do you have any other questions?<|endoftext|>
Others,Im glad to hear that. And your welcome. I hope i could help and hope the best for you and your family.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello there, how is your day going?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there something that you'd like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Question,Wow that sounds like a big problem. Is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel that he is misunderstanding life? That he feels that he deserves things just for existing?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"It sounds like a really toxic relationship - I hear you! I have been in that position also. In the end I felt that I had no choice but to leave. I cannot tell you what to do, though.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Ah, unfortunately a lot of men are like that - before you become seriously committed they seem totally different. Have you considered seeking professional help?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I believe that there are some organisations that will offer free therapy sessions for people in need. Have you considered asking your doctor?<|endoftext|>
Others,I am not totally sure what is available but I think that there might be such things.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Well no, I don't think that all men are like this by any stretch of the imagination. Unfortunately, however, there are some bad apples who give all men a bad name. I am sure that the same applies to women too though!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,You sound to me as though you are being realistic and sensible about your financial situation and are being neither too stingy nor too lavish.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope that I have been able to be of some help to you! Have a lovely rest of day.<|endoftext|>
Question,Ok. That sounds like something that you should talk to someone about. How many classes are you taking at the moment?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That's tough. A full load of courses. Do you have to take all of them right now? Can you adjust your course load?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That's a challenging situation. Can you get help from the professor with the deadlines? Maybe you could look into getting a tutor.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Great! I think a tutor will give you some guidance on how to stay on top of your courses.Your situation is not unusual. Many students have difficulty trying to manage it all. Are you working a job as well?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ok. No worries! Can you adjust your hours at your job? Do you need the money, or can you maybe take a short break from work until you catch up?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"True. Once you're on the other side of this semester, you can put in more hours. Do you absolutely have to finish this semester, or can you put off a course until the next term?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is the job contingent on graduation? Maybe you could take one course while you do the job. Work full-time and study  part-time.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Do you have to get high grades in the courses, or just pass?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Ok. Do your best to pass. Try to cut back an hour or two at the job. Keep you eyes on the prize: the full-time job after graduation.<|endoftext|>
Others,Great! Best of luck with everything then!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi. It sounds like your having a hard time. Is the stuff going on that could be contributing to this?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,My own kid has been home through all this too so I understand.<|endoftext|>
Information,Have you tried to talk to your spouse and see if you can have some you time? Maybe have them take the kids out so you can rest.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I used to be like that too until i found a hobby I enjoyed so I could have something just for me.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure",I think you should try to get back into that. maybe it will help your find yourself a little bit more again. I like to get out and hike. I also really enjoy painting for fun.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you have a lot going on at home and with the way of the world right now I think your are trying your hardest.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",It sounds like your stressed a lot and just having a little trouble finding your way forward. They say getting outside and getting sun helps with your mood and demeaner. Have your tried just walking around the block a few times a week?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",Of course. I am glad i could help. Do you feel like this has helped you?<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi! How's it going today?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That doesn't sound super positive?<|endoftext|>
Question,What's going on? What made her do this?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Not knowing why must be hard, this sounds like it was more of her problem than yours. That's a terrible thing to do to you.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I think she definitely owes you an explanation for what she's done. That was the worst way for her to do that.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Time will help with some of that. Once you're able to make new memories in your apartment it won't be so unbearable. But maybe her hurting you this way means you don't need that explanation because she simply wasn't right for you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"As much as it hurts, it sounds like you're better off without her.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Unfortunately this year has been less than ideal in more ways than one.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","I can understand, it was something to finally look forward to. Unfortunately, everyone is dealing with all of these emotions differently and it was just too much for her. And it's hard to talk to people about our feelings because everyone is in the same or worse situation with the pandemic.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Right, but it is worth talking to someone. I always feel guilty until I finally start talking and then it ends up being a support system between both parties. Not just me dumping my problems on someone else.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Glad to hear it, hopefully with time this will all make sense for you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You as well.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",You've come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband's loss of work and your son's loss of his job is entirely understandable.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Regardless of what your husband's actions are and your son's, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son's behavior.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it's difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won't be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I completely understand that. Especially when it comes to people we are close to, it can be hard to separate our expectations from theirs.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I've had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It's difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn't make you selfish at all.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",You are certainly not alone. Has any of this been helpful? Is there more I can do for you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Well, that's a start. Do I hear you saying that you're confused at the moment?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can't it? What are you supposed to produce?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of  your future and one day it will pay off?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance",I think you are putting yourself down unnecessarily. Many people do make a lucrative career from an art qualification. I would urge you to keep working to the best of your ability and see what happens.<|endoftext|>
Information,Have you ever tried searching for information about careers in your field? We still have a few minutes left :). There are a lot of different ways in which you can use an art degree!<|endoftext|>
Others,That sounds like a definite winner :) I see a Turner prize beckoning in your future.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes I am, where are you?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Ah .. well hopefully things will pick up for you next year. Well it's been lovely talking, I wish you all the best!<|endoftext|>"
Others,and you!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi, How can I help you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anything else bothering you or it is only the college?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","That's good, at least you identified your problem somehow, now is the time to begin solving it. What is stopping you to get prepared for the exams?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I had the same experience in the past, I was doing fine in high school but soon after I entered the college I saw myself falling.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Information","soon I realized that It's not high school anymore, It needs more effort and specially more time to comprehend the lessons. You can't just pass the exams by studying a day before the exam.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I know It's hard these days by the pandemic and all online things.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Then you find your answer by yourself, You NEED yo change.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"And remember, your at college, You should start to seek the answers more by yourself and your college mates and be less dependent on professors.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yes, I had all your problems but I tried to take the control little by little, the problem is still there but now I can manage it better.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I tried different things and I failed many times, You should try too, start to know yourself and how your body and mind works.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Of course, I would love to hear what is going on.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What would you like to discuss?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is great!  I am sure so many people would benefit from the advice and outlook.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","It seems like it might be overwhelming for you to begin.  Maybe you can start small, like think of ideas or maybe just start writing 10 minutes a day. Everybody has a story and we can all learn from others.  You don't need to a famous but just honest with what you have learned from your life.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Maybe you can start with a part of your life that you do feel passionate about first.  I know for me, it's easier to start with something I enjoy the most.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yes, I understand it is easy to get frustrated with a lack of motivation.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","I am happy to help. Sometimes what we need is someone who affirms our dreams. I haven't, I'm not much of a writer.  However, who knows in the future.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Oh, I definitely feel frustrated with myself when I was to start a project and don't have the energy or motivation to go through with it.  This has happened on many home projects or craft project.  Or even with losing weight and make healthy decisions. No, I am glad you asked.  It is important to be honest and learn from others.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, I hope I encouraged you a little to keep going and start you book, at least a part you enjoy. You are welcome.  Good luck with your book.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","Haha, yes, sometimes listening to ourselves can be the hardest! Good bye!<|endoftext|>"
Question,What can I help you with today?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there any reason that triggered  your sadness?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am sorry you feel this way. Do you live with friends or family?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is great that you at least have your dog. They're great companion.<|endoftext|>
Others,How about you hang out once a week with your friends and share your problem with them?<|endoftext|>
Others,Of course. Now that covid is closing everything. You can use that time to take a course online for free. Or you can pursue your hobbies.<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you tried seeking therapist?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think there are quite a few hotline for free, obviously not as good as your personal one, however you can use that when you need to talk to an expert.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I understand how you feel, I also find myself more depressed this year than ever.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Me too, I have been trying to teach myself the ""one day at a time"" mindset to not being paranoid about the future.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"hello, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you want to tell me what happened?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there a reason for you to think that way?<|endoftext|>
Others,"First of all, try not to overthink right now and do your best to review your materials.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"hmm I understand your frustration, have you talked to your professor about this?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","I'm so sorry you were treated that way, it's unacceptable. How about teaching assistant or your friends? You can form a study group and I've found friends can help even more than teachers.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh no don't worry  about that,I believe they are understanding and as long as you ask nicely, they'll be more than glad to help you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yeah, the problem with teachers is they usually don't see from students' perspective while your fellow students do.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"There are a few free online website that can provide help too, I used to check Khan Academy for concepts I don't understand.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"at the same time, you need to make time to relax too, you don't want to overwhelm yourself before the test.<|endoftext|>"

"Providing Suggestions,Information","Well i can see you really care for your niece. It also seems like your sister is a toxic person who is using your family. It may be rough not being able to see your niece but it might be better for your own well being to have this space from her. No keep going, sometimes just getting it out there helps.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Yea usually never anything good about loss. I am glad you are doing better now though. Hopefully she can turn herself around. Oh not a problem at all!<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Your not getting the unemployment office to respond seems to be a common problem.  They weren't geared up for this.  Fortunately, the online portal has been helpful for many. What are your skills and strong points?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You want to know where to start.  Sounds like you are young.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,I am really sorry about that - you are feeling that you've been deserted?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Please don't think that! I have been in this situation and I know how awful it is but I also know that it will pass.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Would you be able to go and visit friends or family members? Get some support?<|endoftext|>
Information,Oh that is not a good idea. Do you think you have an alcohol problem? There are support groups out there who could help you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I hear you. Do you have any pets or anything at all to keep you company?<|endoftext|>
Others,I think you should get the dog back but I don't think you should call your ex - you are better off without him.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","I think you should value yourself more highly than this. If he slept with your best friend then he is nothing. You can do a great deal better, I am sure!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Well quite! You can easily move forward with your life. He will not find it so easy. But do get the dog back.<|endoftext|>

Others,You're most welcome :).<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions",have fun :). you just need to press quit and take the survey now :) I can't do it this end.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm doing okay. What's going on? What has you so down?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that! So many people have been furloughed this year. Do you think they will bring you back?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm sure that has you anxious and probably a little depressed. Are you looking for other employment opportunities yet?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's good that you were able to find another job, but I completely understand about the take home not being enough. Do you work full time, or is it just part time for now?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions","Oh, I understand being nervous about covid exposure, especially if you're working with the public, who may not abide by mask mandates and social distancing. Is there anything you can do to limit exposure? Also, are you able to look for a second job at all? The extra hours may bring in extra income while you try to find a single job that would pay enough.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you're really frustrated. That's completely understandable.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"That is very frustrating. I know I find it very annoying when I see people out and about without masks. It drives me crazy, just thinking about how they're keeping this stupid pandemic going and keeping people out of work.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I wish I had more suggestions for you. I think the only thing you can do is keep looking, make sure your resume is updated and current. If there are any employment agencies in your area, they may be worth looking into. And if there are any public assistance programs you qualify for, there's no shame in seeking help when you need it.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I sure hope it does. I wish you all the luck in the world.<|endoftext|>
Others,You're very welcome. I'm glad I could be here for you.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Others,Okay. Have a good night!<|endoftext|>
Information,I am truly sorry you are feeling this way. Those feelings can be overwhelming. Have you tried talking to a professional about this?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","There are many therapists out there that work on a sliding scale based on your income. Some even offer free sessions. I would look into that for your local area. It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously. I will tell you from experience, ignoring the issue is not going to help.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Information",It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you. One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine. I know my therapist along with many others are doing it this way now. It may not be as great as being in person but it helps having that ear to listen to you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I can relate to that, spend 8 hours cleaning the place up for my 10 year old to tear it all down in 10 minutes. Jobs are a whole other can of worms as well. May i suggest though that, even though big goals are great to strive for, you set a bunch of smaller goals to complete?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Yea just last year they were a baby in my eyes ha. Maybe just even something as apply to 2 new jobs this week. Clean the kitchen on monday. Simple things.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like ""Therapists (My Area) Sliding Scale"". As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Great! I hope for the best for you!<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",so you feel as though your all alone? I am here for you if you need to talk.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings","/sounds like you are depressed ? Well I can assure you that I am here if you need or want to talk about why your depressed. when I get depressed , I just want to be by myself but it does help when I talk it out.<|endoftext|>"

Others,"Oh! my having family members passing away is so awful , I am sorry to hear that and can understand why you are depressed.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you reached out to anyone for support?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have had to in the past when I lost my dad, it wasnt due to covid but I really needed somone that didnt know me.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Your family dr. would give you some information, that is how I was able to find somone. I was very thankful to my dr. And yes, it did help.<|endoftext|>"

Others,"That's okay, just wanted to reach out and see how you are!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that.  So it sounds a bit like you are entering a period of uncertainty and are going to be struggling :(.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","Well i know it is difficult, but just wanted to share that I am here for you in these hard times.  And you're so smart that even if you lose this job you will find another one :). Actually currently I am unemployed too actually, although I have a new opportunity starting next month.  So I know it can be rough.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Well have you thought of any next steps to take?  From what I have seen, it is easier to start looking for a new job before you need to leave the old one.  Maybe you could start job searching sooner rather than later?  I might have some contacts that can help.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Awesome! Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you in these tough times.  It can be useful to take some time to relax too :) Maybe eat a favorite food or talk with a friend or go on a long walk to destress :).<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Awesome, meditation can always help make complex problems feel a bit simpler.  And it is okay to feel upset right now, as long as you realize that things will get better, and that you have lots of people supporting you! Anything else i can help you with? Or are you going to go meditate now?<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome! Hope you have a wonderful week :)  Always good to chat.<|endoftext|>

Others,Bye!<|endoftext|>
Others,You're welcome!<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Others","By surviving, it is more of a personal situation.or an outside dilemma affecting you. is it*.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I see what you mean. Finding work in this environment can be stressful as well. In any case, I can say that a good way to start is to account for all transactions you make.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Are you also pressed for time? Time management can be a predicament as well.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","Wow, it's slightly uncanny the way our situations are similar. For someone who is also not in the best place financially and just making the bare minimum, it can feel hopeless sometimes. I know you are feeling stressed at the moment, but I've realized focusing on the long term helps ease the pressure of current stressors.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I feel that if you can focus on using your extra time as an investment into yourself (whether by reading, picking up a hobby, or working out), you can feel more accomplished and at ease with what you are doing in life.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Being progressive is difficult, but is one of the things in life which compound very easily. I believe many aspects in life are connected and that improving in some parts improves you as a whole.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"And if these ""improvements"" can also make you money/increase your worth/ease your mind, then that can be called a success. In my opinion atleast.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Yeah, but imagine how it would if you had days like that knowing it isn't a bad thing to relax. You have already put in the work in being comfortable before, allowing to enjoy your time however way you wanted. Looks like you already have an interest which can help you in many ways in life. That's really good.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Yes, the tension and pressure only seems to mount on, but there will always be things like that in life. It is important to remember whether such problems are in your control or not. If they are, you know for sure that you can change how you are presently. No problem, this is a very interesting experience for me too.<|endoftext|>"
Question,when did you start having these feelings?<|endoftext|>
Question,is there something specific that began around that time?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is a difficult and trying situation during unprecedented times. This is a temporary situation that will improve in time.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,No one ever could have imagined that this would be how we are having to do things.<|endoftext|>
Question,have you considered discussing your feelings with your husband?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have done a lot of soul searching over the past months and i found small changes in my perspective helped diffuse my stress. I set aside some time to talk to friends and we all share some laughs and some tears and it truly helps.<|endoftext|>
Others,There is no need to thank me. you  are doing what many are trying to do. I pray it all works out for you and your family.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Please consider trying to reconnect with your husband. Simple little kindnesses do so much for the spirit.<|endoftext|>
Others,Every day is a fresh start. kindness from you will be returned.<|endoftext|>

Question,"Hello, how is your day going?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question",A little rainy here but I am okay. How do you feel today?<|endoftext|>
Question,What is causing you to feel frustrated?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It definitely can be challenging finding work in a pandemic but don't give up keep searching I am sure you will find something.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","I are capable of doing whatever you decide, maybe try going back to school. Or you could try a career center that will assist with resumes, interviews, and job searches.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What is it hard for you to get?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","Maybe try reaching out to Human Resources of the company you are applying for to see what qualifications and experience they are actually looking for. You have to stay encouraged keep trying, it's easy to give up.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Well have you thought about changing professions just until thing in your field pick back up?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I understand that you want to do what is enjoyable but how to you know you will not enjoy something else if you don't give it a try?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I recently had to change jobs as well I was very hesitant and not confident about it. Once I started the new job and got the hang of things I couldn't see myself doing anything else at this moment.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It seems that you have a wonderful personality, you just lack a bit of confidence.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You are welcome, now go out there and get that job!! Have a great day!!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Same too you as well.<|endoftext|>
Question,hi how are you today? How can I assist you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems you are working really hard and in stress due to your classes.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,The good part is you are giving your best and keep doing it. don't think too much about the result. These kind of dreams are the worries inside you.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can understand the situation you are going through. You are working hard and keep doing it and try to mediate for few minutes in a day. Hope that will release your stress.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,When I am in stress I do mediation and it gives me relaxation and a new way to think. sometime our body and mind need peace to work better.<|endoftext|>
Others,Mediation is just to concentrate on your breath. There are so many videos on internet. You can take short break when you feel exhausted and talk to friend and family for a while. It will help you.<|endoftext|>
Others,You will graduate with flying colors. My best wishes are there with you. stay focused and calm. That's the mantra. Hope you will achieve whatever you want. Best wishes!<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there something else that I can help you with? The time will go fast. don't worry.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings",You can do it I am pretty sure. Keep working on your goal. I had such kind of anxiety when I was in college. The best way to come out from it is to stay focused and calm.<|endoftext|>
Others,"yes, It happen with all human being I believe.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"hello, my name is Sue, how can I help?<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Reflection of feelings",How is the friendship related to the break up can you please explain? Breakups are such a challenging thing to go through.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So you went through a breakup, and feel that the friends you had in common prefer her to you, so you don't want to see your firends any more, am I understanding correctly?<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Self-disclosure","do you have any evidence they are laughing at you or not liking you?  or is it a feeling you have? I know sometimes I think someone feels a certain way about me, but if I ask them, it turns out not to be true, and it clears the air.   Sometimes it's just in my own head.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question",i see. but HAS anyone laughted at you?  or told you they don't like you?  or not responded when you have talked to them?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"i can relate to this.   I went through a breakup a couple of years ago, and left town.   Part of me is relieved I don't have to see those friends we had in common any more.  I didn't want to be jiudged for leaving him.   So I have experienced some similar feelings.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Ah yes, the public and private can be quite different sometimes for sure. have you reached out to any of these friends to test the waters?  maybe called or texted just to touch base and have a chat that's not emotionally loaded, about light topics?   This might be a non-threatening way to test out how they are feelng about you.  You might be pleasantly surprised, and find that goes well.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"the other thing is these common friends might feel a bit awkard too about the situation.   They have to figure out how to relate to you both on your own, it's a change of dynamics, so might take a bit of time to settle out.   Can you tell your friend that you'd like to go out for a drink but that you don't feel comfortable talking about your ex at all?  Would your friend respect your request if you made one do you think?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","oh I see, yes that could be awkward for sure. i think it's important you go out with your friend, but can understand your reluctance to run into your ex.   Could you go out for coffee or lunch instead?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Ah gotcha.   So do you think you will accept or not?  Or still need time to think about it?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others","i hope if you go that you have an enjoyable time, and that your friend respects your boundaries.  And worse case scenario, if your ex is there, you could leave early...if it were me I'd warn my friend that I might have to. I'm glad you are going!   Take care of yourself and have a good time.   Was there anything else?<|endoftext|>"
Others,you're very welcome.  and you as well!  Bye.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I'm doing fine, you can tell me your problems.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Oooh that's a very complicated situation. They are both adults, I hope even with tension, they don't do anything inappropriate, do they?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Ah, those people are the hardest to deal with. If it's too much, have you and your wife considered moving away?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I understand, you're in a very tough spot. Have your wife ever expressed her annoyance?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's not too bad then. Your wife seems to be mature and understanding. If you can't do anything to completely avoid your ex, maybe your best choice is to limit seeing her as much as possible.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You and your wife can hang out a bit further from your home. It's inconvenient but at least your time won't be interrupted by your ex.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance",I'm here. Of course if you think you're good with my advice.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, just wait for the right time when the person is alone and ask if you could talk.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Remember to take deep breaths, wait for the right time and see if that works for you. I know you can do it.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I have faith in you. Is there anything else we need to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Remember, the outcome may not be perfect but slowly things will come together. Take it one step at a time.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,See if the conversation gives you some insight on how things could be better. Maybe you could see things from someone else's perspective.<|endoftext|>
Question,Would you be willing to give it a try?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Also, if that works, then build from there. Remain calm and little by little talk about your concerns.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Get some good sleep the night before you try having the conversation so you are at your best.<|endoftext|>
Others,You are welcome.<|endoftext|>
Others,i am good how can i help you today?<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",sometimes all we need is some support. just keep searching online and going to different places and putting in job applications i am really sure you will get a job soon.<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am very sorry to hear that, can you tell me a little about the circumstances?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So, you are feeling guilty that you've been breaking the rules and your conscience is catching up with you?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","Well, you won't be able to eat if you get fired ;) I can understand the temptation though - I used to work fast food and I would steal fries sometimes. Do you ever have any  sort of compulsion to steal other things or is it just food?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think that everyone is sometimes tempted to do things that they know that they should not do so do not worry too much but you don't want to risk your job.<|endoftext|>
Others,Unfortunately I was fired. Though not for stealing fries. I was just a terrible cook.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Well, you could try to have a big meal before you go to work so you'd be less tempted?<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,Are you religious? You could make  pledge to God that you would not steal from work anymore.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes I agree. Well, what about talking to family members and promising them that you will stop? You do not want to leave your family penniless. Or, if worse came to worse, would you consider looking for a job that did not involve being around food all day?<|endoftext|>"

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","Waiting for the time to pass is like torture sometimes, I know. I am happy you have more support. Do you have a car or a way to get there if you wanted to?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,well the fact that you recognize that is a big deal.<|endoftext|>

I always overcome some issue. I also write letters just to get out what I'm feeling. It helps and you should try it. Start a diary or write letters to your son so you can share them with him one .

Self-disclosure,I have had to use foodbanks once or twice this year and I did feel a bit bad about it but everyone there was very kind and no-one judged us.<|endoftext|>

"Reflection of feelings,Others",You sound like you have a lot of wisdom. How are you trying to move on?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Do you have a support group, Family, friends?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I have recently separated from my spouse. I know it is a tough journey to walk.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You are so correct about the outcome of Faith.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Moving on from a toxic relationship is important.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,My spouse is Narcissistic and I woke up to the understanding of the abuse.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Most of the time, I feel confident about the breakup but there are times I become insecure. It is during those times, I look to resources to help remind me that I made the correct choice.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I have been developing a support group to help me through. Have you been working on a support group of your own.?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's wonderful!<|endoftext|>
Others,"you are welcome, Is anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about today? I have been online with others who are healing from Narcissistic abuse.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Are you saying that shopping is a form of therapy?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Sorry I'm here, please tell me you problems.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Why do you think that way?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Have you asked your friends regarding this?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Okay, maybe you should ask your friends, let them know how you feel and see what they say about it.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.I hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming. So keep your stance and keep asking for the answer.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","I'm pretty this has happened a few times already, hasn't it? so you have every right to be upset and confront them, you shouldn't feel like you're attacking. You are just asking for what you deserve.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,What you need to do is note down the occasions where they exclude you and ask exactly what happened then.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, that's good, ask them if you did something that offended them and why they excluded you. If they deny, then you can tell them how you feel. If they care about your friendship they will do something to fix.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"honestly, I think you also know that if you care about someone and they feel upset, you'll do everything you can to help the situation. Therefore, if your friends refuse to acknowledge your feelings, I don't think you should be friends either.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hello! How can I encourage you tonight?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you have a lot on your mind and you are losing sleep over it?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sorry to hear that. It can be a bit stressful to think you may lose your job.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have found there are ways to calm myself down when things in my life seem very uncertain.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I make a list of the things I can do - And the things I can't. Then you can have goals. And if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. But if there is nothing you CAN do about the situation, you have to pray to God to help you then LET IT GO. If you can NOT fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It is much more difficult for me to remain focused and positive when I lose sleep. I have had to focus on self care, finding a friend to talk about my problems with, not someone who will TELL me what to do, but support me. So you need a good support system. And I find things like prayer, Bible reading, nice soft sheets to sleep on and some herbal tea like Sleepy Time help me relax before bedtime.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"And be kind to yourself, no one likes to lose a job, it's unsettling. Do try to tell yourself things that are true to encourage yourself, like you will find another job, it might be uncomfortable and hard, but it actually might work out for your good in the long term.  I always found better jobs, but at the time I lost my job, I felt as if the world was ending.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others,Self-disclosure","You aren't in an easy place, but this can actually work out for your good.  I think if you focus on the GOOD that can happen, that might help your more. I would be concerned too, but if you even start looking for a job now, that might help you become more confident. I do encourage you to set goals. I have found that the hard times are often stepping stones to better things, however at the time, all it feels like is hard times! lol. I'm an older lady - I'm almost 60. So I've had a lot of jobs, retired now, but I remember when my husband kept getting threatened with job layoffs. It was really disheartening for him.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"If I had to do it over again, I would have encouraged him more to get that resume out and look for another job. The threat of losing his job was always hanging over his head. Yeah, it's not worth it my friend. Be pro active.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I would also encourage you to get outside and run, or walk or play with the kids or do exercise everyday, because if you are tired physically, that helps reduce stress and helps you sleep.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Sometimes a pay cut in the right company is a stepping stone IN the door, My husband lost a lucrative job one time, he started at a company washing dishes in his 40s, I kid you not, but he wound up moving up and retired early. He wanted to provide for our family, so he was willing to humble himself, Looking back, I'm amazed. But he moved up. Once in that organization, he had lots of open doors, so you never know what God has in store for you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can understand that. Perhaps get together with her and look for ways to cut out spending. These are tough times. Even one car, or chicken instead of steak or canceling netflix or something like that. A few steps back is NOT failure, it can be prioritizing things in a difficult time.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I do want to assure you that even though I don't know you, you sound intelligent and caring and obviously wanting to provide for your family. That's honorable. These are difficult times, I do encourage you to write things down because sometimes stress clouds our eyes and if you set goals and brainstorm, you will be amazed at what you can come up with.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I understand how you feel. It seems as if you are being treated badly for no genuine reason. Is this correct?<|endoftext|>
Question,Who is treating you badly? Do you believe there are any causes behind the actions of those hurting you?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"That must be really difficult to go through, I know when my partner treats me badly, I am hurt and upset with them.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are there any steps you can think of taking to express your frustrations with your husband?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. I am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I can tell from chatting with you that you are struggling and fed up with this situation because you are trying very hard in your marriage but get nothing but disrespect in return.<|endoftext|>
Information,"From what I have seen, if a situation like this continues, not only will you be consumed with anger towards your husband which will all come out at once, but it may also lead to divorce based on research I have read about.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I understand. I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Some people respond to different strategies. You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it. Take a few calming deep breaths and engage in self-care, you deserve it.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>
Question,I am glad to hear it. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Yes I hear you on that, that happens to me rather a lot of the time. Can you tell me more?<|endoftext|>"
Question,That does not sound good. Do you feel that it is someone specifically who is blocking you out?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Well, trust has to come with time... it cannot happen instantly. Perhaps you are being too hard on yourself?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Sometimes you just run up against people who are not trustworthy themselves. It's best to just ignore these toxic people! Please know that it is NOT your problem, it it's their's!<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I do understand how it feels to be gossiped about - that has happened to me more than once and it is really painful.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you should consider getting some new friends? Are there any societies or anything that you could join?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",That sounds like a really positive outlook. Make a resolution not to let toxicity into your life in this coming year? I hope I have been able to help you a little and set your mind at rest. I wish you a very happy New Year!<|endoftext|>
Others,goodbye and thanks for talking.<|endoftext|>
Information,(you need to end from your end as I can't from mine :)).<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","I see, so your main worry is about academic pressure? Is there a specific aspect that you are focusing on?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you been performing below your normal standard this year?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I hear you, I have been in a similar situation. Parents sometimes do not realise just how much pressure they are putting on their children to be perfect.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Exactly! there is nothing at all wrong with not being a straight A student. Have you tried to tell her how you feel about her behaviour and attitude towards your studies?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Absolutely not. There is nothing wrong with not being perfect. And she has no right to emotionally manipulate you by mentioning money.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are there any scholarships or hardship funds that you could potentially look into applying for?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Ah, it is very expensive isn't it? I understand, I am still paying off my loans! But it should be worth it in the end. One day you could get a job working for Amazon!<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Debt is a very scary thing to experience, I know. I do worry a lot about it sometimes too so you are not alone.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"The main thing is, do you enjoy your studies and consider them worthwhile?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I really did enjoy University .. I made a lot of friends and it was a good learning experience. I hope you feel a bit the same?<|endoftext|>
Question,I think that you need to be easier on yourself. Do you have many friends?<|endoftext|>

Question,Would it be possible for you to get a part time job of some description? Maybe bar tending or working in a restaurant?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others",Ah I suffer from terrible social anxiety myself so I hear you. I hope I have been able to provide you with some useful advice!<|endoftext|>
Question,How are you this evening?<|endoftext|>
Question,What class is your exam in?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So just to make sure I understand, you have an exam coming up in economics and you are very stressed about it.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Do you have any study groups set up for the class? Often times it helps to study with people who are in the same situation you are in.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you made any flash cards for the class?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I used to stress out a ton over tests too, but I found that distracting myself every once in a while with a movie or a tv show helps me to reduce stress.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I would recommend mixing it in while studying, maybe study for an hour and then take a break for an hour and the study again. This way it breaks up the monotony of studying.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I used to think of it that way as well, but I then began to think of it as a reward for studying and that helped a lot!<|endoftext|>"
Others,I am glad that I could help!<|endoftext|>
Question,Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,that must be horrible. You were already engaged?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",that sounds really hard. that's a long time to know someone. how long ago did you breka up?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"that's going to be tough for the next little bit, those sound like some pretty fresh wounds. Have you been able to talk to friends?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I had a break up last year and while it was painful for a bit, i used it as an opportunity to focus on myself and the things I needed. It ended up being a really good self reflective opportunity. Maybe join a gym or a group of some kind to change your network a bit?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I like going to the gym alone but that's just my personal preference. There are fitness groups like bootcamps that you could join and meet new people. Who knows, you may meet a new friend.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds hard. You deserve to have friends of your own.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"there are lots of different kinds of groups you can join, not just fitness. and you can choose how much you want to actively engage with them. I would suggest taking time for yourself. Maybe give yourself some distance from him. If you both decide to reach out again in the future that may be an opportunity, but definitely take care of you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"sometimes you just need some distance. I hate that old saying but as it goes ""there are plenty of fish in the sea"".<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Good luck! you got this. Have fun with it, it sounds like you have other guys who are after you ;).<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hello! How may I assist you today?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds you did not sleep. am I right?<|endoftext|>
Others,Oh! sorry to hear about that. I can understand it might be tough for you to deal all this.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know you can handle this tough time situation. These tough time teach us so many lessons and give the solutions too.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,By chatting with you I can totally understand how you are feeling at this movement. Such situations put so much burden on us.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I feel the same when there is some financial or emotional problems in my life. Then I realize why I am not that  strong to face it or why I was not prepare for it?<|endoftext|>
Others,"From my past experience I have leant at tough time like this, we should not give up. We should keep trying and some solution will come definitely.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"What I have seen If we keep trying and stay motivated towards our goal, we for sure get that.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Sure! I would suggest you to keep trying, try to stay positive in this tough time where we all are struggling.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Wishing you best wishes and stay healthy.<|endoftext|>
Others,you too! bye.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",Hello. how are you? how may i help you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,what is making you sad?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated.<|endoftext|>
Question,have you put in job applications everywhere.<|endoftext|>
Information,With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed?<|endoftext|>
Others,yes they do i am familiar with that. how is your resume looking?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,yes i can understand that.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen.<|endoftext|>
Others,good thing is you graduated and congrats on that.<|endoftext|>
Information,your welcome hope my suggestions helped you today.<|endoftext|>
Others,i am glad i could help you.<|endoftext|>
Others,you do the same and no problem :).<|endoftext|>
Question,Of course! What sort of issue is it?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I see, so you feel that your position has become stagnant and you know longer take any pleasure in your work?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are there any opportunities for advancement or retraining in your current position? Perhaps strive for a promotion?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yes I do. I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation. I am sure that there is some solution though!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, you will never know unless you take the plunge into the unknown! I do realise how difficult it is for you to do that though. Perhaps start putting out feelers to other companies? There is no harm in that.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,True! it would also be great for your self esteem to realise just how much more there is out there that you could be doing.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Yes, there is nothing to worry about. Do you have any relevant qualifications that might help you find another job?<|endoftext|>"
Question,It all sounds very promising. If you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?<|endoftext|>
Question,"One other suggestion - it's a high risk strategy but do you think your boss might be sympathetic if you discussed this with him or her? You never know, they might even have some good suggestions - perhaps they feel the same!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,No I do not believe that you are overthinking at all.  This is a very important aspect of your life and will shape your future!<|endoftext|>
Others,You are most welcome - I hope that I have been able to give you some peace of mind.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Please let me know how things go for you in the future - I am sure that in six months time things will be looking a lot brighter!<|endoftext|>
Others,Erm .. cup of coffee?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, how are you tonight?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm doing well how can I help you tonight?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little? Do you get paid vacation time in your job?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you're keeping safe! I'm not sure of all the details on your job so I'm having a hard time making firm suggestions. How would you feel about that?<|endoftext|>
Others,"sure, please go ahead and share your story.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,that's great! Friends can be big help.<|endoftext|>
Others,"If you have time, spend at least 1-2h everyday outdoor. You can talk a walk in the park or just simply go to the stores.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Reflection of feelings","In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier. spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I'm also sick of the repetition too. Everyday I go to work then go home and just get stuck there all nigh every day. However, we need to tell ourselves that this too shall pass.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,that's the right way of thinking. You're doing this not only for yourself but for everyone else.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I try to stay away from the news or talking about covid, mostly because it's gonna be the same information and only depresses us even more.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I don't think I am better than you but we have to try nonetheless.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"it's the same for me, businesses are forced to tighten again which is grim. However, the only think we can do now is take 1 day at a time and hope for the best.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I believe the same as long as we hang in there. Get help from your friends and family.<|endoftext|>
Others,It was nice talking to you too.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I'm sorry to hear you're feeling that way, what has you feeling this way?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh no, that's not good. Do the other kids see it as well?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Does your husband realize that the other child notices it and how it hurts them?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Why do you think he favors that child? Is that child only with you part-time that he feels he needs to make the most of that time?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Is there someone that's close to both of you that you could talk to, that way they can help him see that it's very apparent that he's treating him different?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","Very true, and it would likely be better with someone no quite so close to the situation. But you also don't have to attack him to her, just lay out the facts. I understand the frustration, it's hard to see your kids hurting or feeling like they're not enough. Is this the biggest issue you guys are dealing with in your marriage? Or is it just another thing you're not getting along on?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Someone who has seen you interacting as a family and maybe has noticed it as well.<|endoftext|>
Others,Sometimes just getting it off of your chest is all you need to reset. I'm glad that helped and I wish you luck in finding a solution.<|endoftext|>
Others,"You too, stay safe!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Im sorry to hear that. how can I help.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",That is always tough especially during this time of year and been there myself. What type of rejection  are you experiencing.<|endoftext|>

Others,"think about it,  the added exercise will help you from getting lonely with her not being around.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"If you focus too much on the break up,  you will have a hard time getting over her so try to do some fun activities that you can enjoy alone  so that you are safe.  You can search youtube on how to do laundry and other chores,  you will be ok.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,You are welcome. Everything will be okay just know that.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Right and you have to take control of those negative thoughts and replace them with positive thoughts.<|endoftext|>
Information,You are right you have to learn to control your feelings towards a situation.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Don't let depression take full control of you then it will be all bad.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,once you learn how to have control over your feelings over situations then it will be pretty easy to maintain.<|endoftext|>
Others,Yes seeing a doctor would really be helpful for you.<|endoftext|>
Others,No problem. have a Merry Christmas and cheer up please :).<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I am glad I helped you today. Take Care.<|endoftext|>
Others,Hi there! How can I help you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,I hear you. Is there a particular reason why you might feel this way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Is it that your life is just getting so stressful and busy that work feels like the last straw? Correct me if I'm wrong.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Ah, I understand that feeling completely. It's totally normal given the current situation and even without the whole virus situation, life is just tough. Do you work in the mornings?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question",Just from hearing that I can imagine your stress and how hard it must be to get through a single day. Do you think it would be possible to get a day off or change your hours a bit?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Ah, that could be exactly what you need! I suggest you take that time to completely detox and get away from work and your problems.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Until then, I suggest you prepare a little bit for the trip each day. Give yourself something to look forward to.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","For example, packing a bit of clothes each night or planning which places you'll visit. Yes! Morning exercise will definitely help eliminate stress  and make you feel better about your health and more comfortable. Take it slow and don't forget to breathe :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,No problem! Is there anything else I can help with today?<|endoftext|>
Others,Have a great day and no problem!<|endoftext|>
Others,"I will, thanks.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Just so I understand, your supervisor recently quit and you'd like to apply for her job but you're worried you won't be accepted?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sure they won't see you as needy or desperate if you've been with the company for 2 years already. Have you initiated the conversation with the board already?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That is a good idea. I would go over your resume and spruce it up before talking to them on Wednesday to add in anything pertinent that you might have learned or achieved during your time with the company these last two years. Make sure the day you approach them that you're well rested, clean and put together. Google some confidence stances and pay attention to your posture. Even if you're feeling nervous there are ways to hide it and appear confident.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"No problem, I hope it helps.<|endoftext|>"
Others,If you feel that he might be able to provide more advice then sure.<|endoftext|>
Information,"If he isn't interested in the job himself I'm sure he wouldn't see it that way. It is natural for people to try to move up in a company when a job opening appears, especially in these current times. If you don't go for it then someone else will.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Having support in the workplace would be very helpful. If he truly does not want the job himself perhaps you could approach him about a memo or something that would back you? Something you can add to your resume from a peer that shows your initiative.<|endoftext|>
Others,That could benefit you as well.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Unless you're known for doing bad things in the office I wouldn't sweat the gossip honestly. People are either going to support you or be jealous, either way I wouldn't let the talk get to you. Do you feel like you're ready to tackle the tasks needed to prepare yourself for approaching the board Wednesday?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I would say maybe try some meditation or something to calm and center yourself. If you feel ready earlier than Wednesday then follow your intuition. You've got this!<|endoftext|>
Others,It was my pleasure.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,How are you friend?<|endoftext|>

Question,Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem? Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I can assure you that countless students including myself have gone through the trials of studying for exams and do feel overwhelmed but it passes. Have you studied?<|endoftext|>
Information,"I get it, distractions can be challenging to overcome at times. Have you thought about going to a library, or a book store?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,If it helps you study then the library may be worth the time and effort. Sometimes we can stress out over worrying about not having enough time to study. But trust the work you have done and you will know if it is enough.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Yes, and it wasn't easy but with hard work, it is completely doable. And you have the power within yourself.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Sometimes it is not about the amount of studying, but the way you study. I like reading my textbooks and highlighting the important parts and then rewriting them so they become ingrained in me. But let us not jump the gun, you haven't failed anything.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Don't forget to breathe. Exams are stressful but I would suggest don't cram everything to the last minute. Usually the hour before the exam, I do something else.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Stay calm, believe in yourself, start your studying early so you are not cramming everything in the last few days.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Walk outside, away from the students waiting for their tests.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anything else I can help you with?<|endoftext|>
Others,Goodnight and good luck.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I'm very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin?<|endoftext|>
Question,I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this?<|endoftext|>"
Question,That's great!What ways do you think you could communicate more with your family?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting. Do you think doing that would make you feel less depressed?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off-hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, it's worth a try, right!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you for allowing us to complete this task as well. I know depression can cause us to lose motivation, so I really appreciate it. I hope you feel better.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You are welcome. Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
Question,Why do you feel that way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You seem really concerned about gun rights. Does that sound possible?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Thank you for your service. I can understand how that might be a difficult situation for you, especially with your experiences. How are you handling this situation?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You are welcome. That is really kind of you to want to protect your children from harm. It seems like you feel the best way to do this is through owning guns? Have you thought of any alternatives, since the votes have been cast?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","That is a good point you bring up about the quickness and efficiency of protection that guns can provide. How you thought of any other alternatives that could help your family, regarding the process of obtaining guns during a Biden presidency?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Definitely! My first step would be understanding the gun policy that Biden would have and confirming the new process. Does that sound like something that could be a good starting point?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think you are just being careful and protective of your family. That is very honorable of a veteran like yourself.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Yes, that sounds like the case. Are there any practices that have helped you when you're worried?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Don't be embarrassed! To be honest, I have had experiences with some of those, including deep breathing. I also find it helpful.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Of course! I am glad to share and help :).<|endoftext|>
Others,Yes it was nice. I hope you have a great holiday season as well!<|endoftext|>
Question,Good afternoon! How are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I know how stressful that can be! I think if we put our heads together  we should be able to figure out a plan. Did you work before?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",Ok so did you get laid off due to Covid or did you quit or general what happened. It appears you can read my mind. Before I even get a chance you already answer it.. LOL.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Information,Providing Suggestions",OK so do you have any other experience or all food industry? Due to Covid it is very SCARY and real health concern. In my area some places are hiring but still scary. Well how about getting paid to do surveys in your home  and you can do your hours as you want?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Or at least until you can find something to temporarily give you some money. Also what about unemployment?<|endoftext|>
Others,I was going to suggest that and also do you know how to add chrome extensions?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Search google  maybe for unemployment in your county or call unemployment office.<|endoftext|>
Others,Chrome extensions are extension you can download onto chrome browser.  Like I am using Chrome. Do you know what you are using?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Thank God for youtube you can search for almost anything.  I am not kidding . Anyways there is this add on I just discovered called turk guru made to go with mturk.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,It is free for two weeks than subscription but I doubled my money in the two weeks. It helps to accept hits faster than they come thru so you get to get some high paying one.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,and its .33 day and anyone can do that in a day to help pay for it.  3 years and 2months with turk guru.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others",wow thats more than I make maybe I should be taking guidance from you. lol.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can understand how stressful that can be. I have two boys and two dogs okay and two fish.<|endoftext|>
Information,It was better when we could request payment daily now soonest is 3 days and I ll tell you what . It has saved us a few times even though it was like $30 it was enough to hold us to payday fri.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I think saltwater I dont know we had few years and there fish. Sorry. LOL  I didnt pay attention. Sometimes just laughing helps . Laughter makes you young and happy.<|endoftext|>
Others,Please give me a moment.. I have to do something quick. BRB.<|endoftext|>
Others,Sorry boys fighting roblox .  LOl. I don't think you are supposed to say that in chat.. FYI. Nor are we probably allowed to talk about mturk.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I am glad I could help and truthfully you never know where and when God will send you to get a little help encouragement or Big help.  No offense / I believe in God and did way before Covid. Good luck and I spoke complete Truth.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,my 7 yr old is OBSESSED with roblox .  LIves breathes talk  drive me nuts and screams to his 9 year old brother who is sitting in chair in same room livingj rooom.<|endoftext|>
Question,How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Trying to be positive about the dumpster fire of 2020 lol, but positivity is kind of hard to maintain wouldn't you say?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Totally! It's hard to plan for success when life seems a bit uncertain. Is there anything in particular that's bothering you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Ah yes, the cog in the machine sort of vibe. Boy do I feel that. Well, the good thing is your not alone. The bad thing is societal pressure demands that we be productive or we think we're wasting time. When's the last time you took a day to enjoy something you like to do?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What activity or activities are you thinking about? Anything that you enjoy or makes you smile.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Ah weddings, did you have fun?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Nice! Well, two kids is A LOT, especially since they aren't in school yet. You are dealing with the care and growth of the most complex organism on this planet...times two! That's incredible. First of all, give yourself a pat on the back for that. Secondly, is it ok if i ask if you felt guilty for having fun without them? Often times guilt robs us of the ability to take care of ourselves, which happens to me all the time.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think that's a systemic problem. Guilt is this powerful check when we do things that are wrong but self love is not wrong. When you constantly take care of others, you might forget to take care of yourself. We are only able to give the best version of ourselves when we feel validated. Perhaps there is a daycare or at home assistance program that will help give you the time to remember how great you are! Do you have some friends or close relatives that can talk with?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Have you asked them? I don't mean to be rude, but I have trouble asking for help and sometimes asking people for help seems like this huge, monumental task. But people can often surprise you. Of course, If you have, then I'd suggest looking up some motivational apps and trying meditation. While it can be hard with two young kids, meditation, even for only a few minutes, will help you relax through your doubt long enough to handle the challenges of the day. When you say you feel like your failing, do you think it is because you hold yourself a standard that is hard to reach?<|endoftext|>"
Question,why is that? because of covid?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question,Question","so, your friend and thier friends make plans in front of you but dont invite you? have you ever just showed up? maybe they assume talking in front of you is like an invite. or have you ever asked your friend what is going on?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance",that has to be frusterating. have you thought about moving on and finding better friends? it sounds like you are a great person and you deserve a lot better than that.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"i understand that, i am an army veteran.<|endoftext|>"
Others,what about having a dinner for some other couples in his unit? have him plan a get together? even drinks and bowling or something.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,fair enough. well maybe you can just hang in there till this stupid virus thing is over i heard the fda has approved a vaccine for emergency purposes . i bet military will be some of the first to get it.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,i bet once they get the soldiers vaccinated the  rules on get togethers will get less strict!<|endoftext|>
Others,"just hang in there till 2020's over, we don't much longer till 2021, and then its a whole new year!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,the whole world hopes so! lol.<|endoftext|>
Question,"hi, how are you doing?  Would you like to discuss anything today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Good also, what would you like to discuss?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It sound like you are feeling very overwhelmed and unsupported by your parents.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have felt this way too, perhaps sit down with them and your brother and talk the situation out.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you can write a letter to your parents.<|endoftext|>
Question,Does your brother want your help?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Then perhaps tell him you do not want to help him, that you have the right to pursue your own dreams.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Sounds like that is a great plan.<|endoftext|>
Others,your welcome.<|endoftext|>
Others,same to you. bye.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I am so sorry to hear that. That can be a really hard time and problem to navigate. Five years is a really long time too.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is a horrible shock to hear something like that. I  thank you for expressing yourself today it can be hard to share a disappointment.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You have good instincts when you can face a situation and make a judgment and decision.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Yes, you can feel like you have invested a lot after 5 years. I can imagine you have a lot of the same friends and that can be hard too.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I can relate to on that level. When I went through a divorce I had to part with my house and pets. I went to live in an apartment and met a really nice guy next door and wound up marrying him. There can be light at the end of the tunnel.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Being anger is valid and you have every right to be mad. You have been betrayed and have to work through problems that you didn't create. Do you have any close friends you can confide in sometimes?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That is fortunate and reflects what a good person that you are to have developed a close friend that you can trust. Maybe she could be your support when the evening and weekends get hard for you?<|endoftext|>
Information,If you are interested in religion often times they have local support groups to join as well.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Okay, an alternative is joining a local group that meets up for exercise in the park. Just an idea.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That is great news. Most of all thank you for sharing your feelings today and opening up. You are a path to healing but being so expressive and open.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear that . How can I help?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Self-disclosure",I understand. Tell me what's going on. I'm here to listen.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions,Question",I understand. It is a scary time right now. Things will not always be this way though. We will get through it. The important part right now is to stay safe and healthy for yourself and for your family. What kind of work did you do before the pandemic?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Yes our country is in a lot of uncertainty right now. And having a second income always helps. Have you considered possibly finding a work from home job? Perhaps look at what skills you've developed, and update your resume to reflect the skills you have that will transfer over to a work from home job.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I understand. There are always companies or jobs out there that are scams. What I found worked best was looking at reputable sites like LinkedIn, GlassDoor, etc. Right now is a good time to find a work from home job from reputable companies. I've found that a lot of companies have transitioned over and developed jobs that can be done from home. I actually work from home myself.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Another suggestion I can make is contacting your local workforce department  (department of unemployment) as they can make suggestions too.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You already have a lot of skills you didn't think about. As a stay at home parent, you are like the CEO of your own company. You manage day to day operations. You also do scheduling, finance management, etc.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I understand feeling guilty for asking for help.  But don't worry that is what they are there for!<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",I AM FINE. HOW IS YOUR SIDE ?<|endoftext|>
Question,Please how may i be of help.<|endoftext|>
Others,okay.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I could see how bad you feel because of that.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings","It happens anyway, but not all the time. when did it start and what do you think that can cause that.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Reflection of feelings","I am like that sometime,  I switch to what I love doing most. it good to be safe, pandemic has caused my hoodlums.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"do you have anything?, that you love doing most.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I love playing soccer game, anytime I am not motivated to work or do anything in office or home, I pick my phone play soccer game. I will laugh, enjoy myself, within 5 minutes , I do gain my morale.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"that is good, reading is a good hobby.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems you like reading novel.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Others","very fun, within some minutes , you will be alive back and motivated. that is good, you can have soft copies on your phone, open it anytime your are bored.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"it is a nice time chatting with you, if your are okay with that you can end the chat.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Thats great! How are you feeling?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know that things have been hard during this pandemic for a lot of people.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Mixed feelings have you been having? It's completely normal and understandable to have them. Sometimes when you are having mixed feelings, you can try writing them down on a piece of paper. This can help you identify how you are feeling.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I could understand how difficult that must be for you. You could try taking a walk outside and getting some fresh air. Fresh air can always help to clear your mind.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions","Does doing art work help you to feel better usually? You can try to immerse yourself in something you really enjoy doing. Sometimes if you smile while doing things, it can help you to feel better.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You're so welcome. I really hope you get back to feeling better soon, Stay safe and have a great rest of your week. Come back if you need any support.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"I had a problem sleeping before, is it ok if I give you some suggestions that helped me and might help you too?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Try practicing meditation and yoga, and avoid mobile phones atleast an hour before you sleep. Chamomile tea also helped me relaxed before.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That's wonderful that you're very open, I'm sure you will be well in no time. If you still have a hard time sleeping, feel free to contact us again. We'll be happy to help.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"You seem like a very nice person.  And his behavior is very toxic, to say the least.I know that things are hard right now, but things will get better.And you deserve to be with someone who will treat you with kindness and respect.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Question","Try not to lose hope.It's hard out there, particularly with what the pandemic has done to the economy.But from what I've read today, more stimulus from the government is on the way, so that should help some. Do you have anyone that you can talk to about what you're going through?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Don't let him make you feel ashamed.  You've done nothing to warrant such a feeling.Maybe you should find someone outside of your social group to speak to.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"There are places you can go to speak to people.  Charitable organizations, clergy if you are religious, and call centers.  Perhaps you could find one of those organizations locally to help you through this.  Also, since they would be local, they might have more information about legal remedies you could pursue.  Some of your ex's behavior sounds criminal...<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I glad I could be of some help.  Just remember, you are a good and worthwhile person.  You will come through this.  I believe in you.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Correct me if I'm wron.g, your children are now online learning, and you are feeling defeated because your husband is pulling away and not providing you the support you need?<|endoftext|>"

"Others,Providing Suggestions",I really feel as though you are the one putting all the effort in here and she is just making selfish demands on you. Perhaps it is time to try and make some new friends? Join a society or something?<|endoftext|>
Others,I think you know deep down what is the best thing to do. You don't need selfish people in your life.<|endoftext|>
Others,You have your boyfriend though :). He will always be there for you - and not treat you as badly as she has!<|endoftext|>
Others,I don't think you owe her an explanation after how she has behaved. Leave her to make the next move. I hope I have been able to help you a little!<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,"I have! I went through hiring agencies and got one. It did take a while, but it was super helpful.<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,So you feel as though you have been working hard all your life and now you need help and support and are not getting it.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others",I know how you feel .. I sometimes feel I would have been better off if I'd just not bothered working! Anyway thank you for talking and I really hope things go better for you in the future :).<|endoftext|>

Have you considered any ways in which you could start to work through what you're feeling?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others","It's great to hear that you are on a medication that will hopefully help you. Have you also considered speaking to an outpatient therapist or someone along those lines? That way, you could return to the same person as often as you feel necessary to continue to work through your feelings with someone who isn't directly involved with your situation. I think that focusing on different hobbies that you enjoy is an incredible way to take your mind off of everything and to keep yourself busy! What types of hobbies are you into?<|endoftext|>"

It was very difficult for me to do in the beginning, but once I got to know them, they provided me with coping strategies that otherwise, I never would have thought of.

Providing Suggestions,"i'd like to offer a suggestion.  please try, as best as you can, NOT to think about the sleep issue.  millions of people have sleep issues. you are not alone.  try thinking about other things, and if your mind comes back to the sleep problem, try thinking about something else.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"It's great to try to integrate it into your day. All of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. Even if it's during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! It's all about being in the here and now.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"When things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. One thing I've learned to be helpful when I'm stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three. The counting tends to distract my mind from whatever stressful thing I was thinking of before.<|endoftext|>"
Question,You're welcome! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Others,"My pleasure! I hope things start to look up for you. This has been a difficult time for all of us, but we'll pull through together! Nice speaking with you. Have a great day!<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,It must be hard time for you. You should not worry about her. You should think about your job and the poor girl who is trapped with her.<|endoftext|>

Question,Are you considering switching jobs?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Absolutely. It's a rough time job searching under the best of circumstances.<|endoftext|>

"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",Absolutely. I also spoke with a therapist before and it helped me a lot. Have you considered reaching out to a professional to talk to?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Affirmation and Reassurance","They can be, but many local governments and municipalities have therapists that work on a sliding scale if the financial aspect of therapy is a concern. Therapy can definitely be a large expense though.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If it helps to reframe the expense, you can try to think of it as an investment in your mental health.<|endoftext|>"
Information,The therapist could likely give you some tools to help manage the frustrations at your workplace more constructively.<|endoftext|>
Others,Absolutely. I hope that you're able to find some peace at your workplace with your boss.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,It seems like you're doing very well despite what happened.<|endoftext|>

Others,"you're welcome, it's nice to meet someone with positive attitude.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"hey friend! I should let you know that if you have typed in a description, i cant see it. how are you doing ?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"If you're willing to share, please.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,ouch. that sounds like it really hurts. how are you feeling about that? betrayed? sad? mad?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Yeah, its a low blow. What are you looking for around this?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Closure seems only reasonable.  Realistically, logically, I can't give that to you here. I can do all sorts of other things though. I can remind you that all that you feeling is totally valid!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"And know that closure isn't something anyone can give you, you can give it to yourself. You may never forget this act, but you have the option to forgive, to be compassionate to whatever you friend may be going through, and act with love.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Understood. Your feelings are definitely valid.  Do you have a plan in place for supplementing your work?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well I'm not sure what type of gig work you do, however, just the fact that you are a gig worker for a long time tells me a few things....1, you are a self starter 2. You have great pritoritizing and time management skills 3. You learn new things easily and with little instruction.  All of these things are skill sets that many employers find extremely desirable. Perhaps try networking online to find opportunities related to your line of work, either in gig work or for a company. Perhaps even looking for an opportunity as a consultant.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Perhaps thats where networking may help. If you are able to find employment that is similar to gigwork, you may be able to have a schedule to works for you.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","I am not too familiar with gig work, but perhaps you know of a site that is similar to Indeed.com but specifically for your line of work or for gigwork . What kind of work do you do?<|endoftext|>"

Information,She did not like your career path?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Reflection of feelings",If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took  and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don't support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self.<|endoftext|>

"Reflection of feelings,Others,Self-disclosure",Yeah it is a difficult time and understandable to be worried about financial stability. a. Are you worried you may lose your job? I lost mine during the peak of the 2008 financial crisis and went through a similar struggle.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It may be a stressful situation, but it may be best to update your resume and begin to check out other job listings. You want to hope everything works out, but you do not want to be blindsided.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Yes the lockdown has been difficult. It has been tough for me too. I live in a city with a lot of parks and nature trails and it has been very beneficial to get out when I can. Do you have a similar situation?<|endoftext|>

"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I haven't experienced addictions but I have been supporting my daughter with her addiction for many years, and I have seen how challenging it's been for her. She has found AA very helpful, and gets a lot of support from her peers there.  Have you tried going to an AA meeting?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"The thing about AA is everyone in the room will be understanding and nonjudgemental and supportive.   And you can learn from them what has worked for them.

They have a code, outside meetings nobody is to disclose that you were there.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"I'm doing well, thanks. Is something bothering you?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately I didn't receive the message you had typed, would you like to talk about it?<|endoftext|>"

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Your manager sounds unsympathetic. That's very frustrating. A lot of people are in your situation in this pandemic: too much work, not enough help. Do you want to leave the company? Look for greener pastures?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Very true. Have you talked to your co-workers about this issue? What do they think?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance","Yeah, that's a good point. A little complaining is ok, but a lot can get on people's nerves. They want to be sympathetic, but after a while, they just get tired of you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,What do you do outside of work? Hobbies and such.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others","You could try setting aside an evening or two a week for time with your BF. Just walk out of the office. Try to set some boundaries. That might seem dangerous and risky, but sometimes it's important to set boundaries. If you don't do that, then the managers can just keep taking advantage of you and your work ethic.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"From what you're saying, it sounds like you think you have no power. Is that true? Are you really powerless in this situation? Do not underestimate your power over your life.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It sounds like the managers are training you to be resigned to your fate. If they listen to you, it encourages you to complain. If they ignore you, you go away and leave them alone. However, if you leave work early (after 9 hours, say), then they might notice you. Are you willing to take a risk?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's the spirit! Taking control of your own schedule is one display of confidence.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I'm doing well, thank you!<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm so sorry to hear that. What's going on that's making you feel that way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That's terrible. So you had an argument and he hasn't spoken to you in two weeks. Is that correct?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure",I can imagine that you must be really hurt amongst a number of other feelings. Hearing you tell me that he has done this is upsetting to me as well. I've had the same thing done to me and I can remember being extremely distraught.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Do you mind me asking what the argument was about? If you don't mind going into a little more detail, I may be able to help you more.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions,Others","That must be such a terrible feeling. So the argument started because you were sick, he didn't check in on you at all for that entire day, and when you expressed your feelings to him, it turned into an argument? Has he ever acted this way towards you before? For example, has he ever shown a lack of empathy towards you like this in the past? Are you still there? Have you tried reaching out to him throughout the course of these past two weeks to see if he would respond? I would really like to help you find a solution to this problem, but it appears as though you may not be active anymore. I'm going to wait a few more minute for you to respond before cancelling the chat. In the event that I don't hear back from you, I wish you the best!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Hello, I hope you are as well. Is anything the matter?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I feel the same way. I cant wait for life to be normal again. It has been a hard year.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Do you live alone? Do you mean meeting new people or getting together with people you already know? I am naturally an introvert, so it honestly didnt bother me the first month or so... but I'm so over it now. I wish I had taken advantage of freedoms we had before all of this.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I think it will pass eventually, but who knows when. It feels like every where you look things are falling apart sometimes. What kind of place do you live in?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"You're so right.... I miss not fearing the virus. I don't fear at as much as I did, but I fear giving it to a loved one. Do you travel a lot for work?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Some people are on lockdowns, I'm nervous about our income in the next few months with the talk of more stay at home orders. I know it feels like itll be like this forever but I really dont believe it will. It may get worse before it gets better but I think things will go back to normal eventually.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I have traveled states recently and the difference is crazy! I went through Tennessee, missippi, and alabama and stopped a few times.. some places are just going on like normal, hardly any masks.. in arkansas you never see anyone indoors without one.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I totally agree. And you never know what is true or not. Its stressful. I'm in georgia now and most people do not wear them unless asked. I've only been required to at dr appointment. Is it mandatory where you are now?<|endoftext|>
Others,There are signs here but half the shoppers dont wear them. I think people here dont fear it as much as other places.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,So you travel because you want to? YES the gas station closest to me.... I have been in there every other day recently and never seen a person in a mask. The employees at the dollar general close to me dont wear them either. I dont think it will either honestly. Sometimes I feel guilty if I'm not wearing one. The uncertainty of everything gets to me.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Reflection of feelings",I wear mine to protect other people.... I do have health issues that could complicate things but I dont thing it will stop me from getting it. I MISS THEM TOO.

"Reflection of feelings,Question",I totally get what you are saying. Adulting is difficult. Do you think it would help to talk about your money issues with your friends?<|endoftext|>
Information,Have you tried using scripts like hit forker and jr panda crazy? They are basically extensions that help to pick up the higher paying hits for you. I use it myself and it's very helpful! There are lots of Youtube videos that show you how to use them.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You are very welcome! You could also try going to temp agencies to find employment. They typically set you up with work that you can start almost immediately if not immediately.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I try. I was working at a bookstore at minimum wage for 2 years so I totally understand where you are coming from and had coworkers that also had kids. The best advice I can give is to continue to put yourself out there and take opportunities as they come even if they are short term because the more experience you have, the easier it is to find a better job even during the pandemic.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi, how are you doing?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like it would be quite frustrating for your friend to talk way too much on the phone.<|endoftext|>
Question,My goodness! How do they respond when you ask to end the conversation?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings",I wonder what it would be like for him if you hung up the phone even after he said he still wanted to talk. Wow--that does sound annoying that he will repeat the same pattern the next time.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,That sounds really difficult if he gets offended so easily. I find it hard to talk to some of those kinds of friends.<|endoftext|>
Question,What do you get out of the friendship with this other person?<|endoftext|>
Question,That sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. Were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.<|endoftext|>

Information,Humor is really helpful for a lot of people.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Sometimes, people draw or do something else distracting with their hands when talking to someone who dominates the conversation.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Self-disclosure","Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. And, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded. The strategy works well for me with some of my family members who seem like they will never change. But, with distraction, I enjoy them all the more.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anything else that you like to do that would be distracting while also letting you somewhat participate in the conversation?<|endoftext|>

Question,If it were entirely up to you how would you like your relationship to proceed from here?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It sounds like you worry you will not be able to trust him in the future because of this no matter what his future actions are, do you think there is anything he could do or say that would change this?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What would you define as full commitment from him?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"That's true and divorce can be expensive. You mentioned before that you feel like you are with him mostly because you are lonely, is that how your relationship started?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I don't think you are naive, you are clearly asking yourself the right questions about building a future with him.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you have friends and family around that could help distract you from the loneliness until you find someone you are comfortable starting a family with?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Of course! There also probably community resources where you can meet new people and explore new interests! Unfortunately I think a lot of that might have to wait til Covid passes.<|endoftext|>
Question,Of course! Anything else on your mind you would like to discuss?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I know, I've heard some people have found success with zoom dates.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,Drastic changes in our life plans can feel very upsetting and looking for a job in these times is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
Question,What made you feel the need to drop out of graduate school?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I understand that and that was a really brave choice to make before you cornered yourself into a degree that wouldn't benefit your future paths.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you gone and smoke to your local job centers? They can often times find suitable jobs or even creative suggestions that can utilize your skills and even grown them.<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information,Others",Im sorry you feel that way but education is never a wasted effort it can only make you level up even if you choose not to actively use what you acquire. Its always nice to have a big back up arsenal so you have options when something you want does turn up. Im really glad that suggestion might be helpful for you. Have you checked to see if any of the credits you have earned already are transferable to another degree you may find of interest?<|endoftext|>

"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Since you are a software developer, isn't there a possibility for you to work from home? Many companies are offering their employees being able to work remotely. I understand your depression, losing a job is not easy, but I am sure that you will get through this.<|endoftext|>"

Self-disclosure,"No, I don't find that to be healthy, and I don't enjoy them.<|endoftext|>"

Others,You are the one that needs to do it!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"If you read the instructions, you will see that you have to hit the ""quit"" button and answer a survey about my performance. I can not end the conversation, only the support seeker can. I am doing my job.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hi, how are you doing?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question","I'm doing ok, thanks for asking. Is there anything that's bothering you?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question",Oh no I'm sorry to hear that. do you want to talk about what happened?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question","It sounds like this is really affecting you, that must be hard. How long were you and your partner together?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question",I've been through break ups as well where things can seem pointless afterwards. It took me some time but I eventually got through it. Were you happy in the relationship?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I talked to my friends about it a lot, and tried to keep myself occupied with lots of activities. I also deleted old messages from my partner so I didn't dwell on the past as much.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","It depends on the situation, but for me I had a lot of unresolved feelings from not getting proper closure, so ranting to my friends about how my partner hurt me helped satisfy that.

Providing Suggestions,"I think it could be helpful, friends can be really supportive.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's awesome that even though you're feeling so depressed, you're willing to give something a try to help you out of it.<|endoftext|>"

Question,How long have you been hesitant to start?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I get it. Sometimes I find dishes so overwhelming that I will let them pile up. Maybe together we can figure out a way to break it into smaller tasks.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It is so hard to figure out where to start sometimes. Ok, I'll help with a plan. Maybe you can glance at the dishes and pull out the largest one that is dirty. Let's start there.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"yes, starting with the large pot would be a great place to start! Good thinking!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well, washing the pot will make the overall task look smaller. Then, let's pick a second type of dish to focus on. After you wash the large pot, try to focus on larger bowls, then plates and cups. You could leave the silverware for last.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Do you live far away from your family?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I can understand that, covid has messed with so much this year.<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,"I try to find the positives, which I'll admit get harder to find by the day. But trying to embrace a more simplistic lifestyle, being more present, etc.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yeah, we're not far from Chicago and the weather doesn't look like it's going to change that for a bit.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Same here, I'd love to get outside as it usually makes me feel better but wind today and subzero chills tomorrow don't look promising.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,Sometimes it is for the best to set clear boundries.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Is Grand mother ashamed of you or her daughter? I feel it should be her ashamed of her daughter.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,At least that is a good thing to come out of a bad situation.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,Or sell it now and pocket the money to recoup what was lost.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So she is just talking circles and not accomplishing what she says?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions","Some people do choose that life to be free of responsibility. Have you had a talk with her about seeing a mental health professional, She may be having some issues that would benefit from care.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Often police officers are not fully trained in helping mentally ill people, they only access if the person is a danger to themselves or others.<|endoftext|>"
Information,A good first step is taking her to your local mental health provider. Or ask at a major emergency room where this is located as sometimes the places are hard to find.<|endoftext|>
Others,Without treatment she may just be getting worse. That is good to hear..<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That does make it difficult when a partner encourages you to engage in unhealthy behavior.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I suggest talking to your girlfriend about how it makes you feel when she insists you continue a relationship that causes so much pain.<|endoftext|>
Others,It was nice talking to you.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",Are you having a good day? why what happened?<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, definitely.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I worked for a boss who gave me a chance when I was rather unhirable.  I worked there for three years, but I was burning out hardcore.  She was kind but she paid me much less than a normal professional would in that position, and took advantage of me.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"She and her husband ran the business, but I continued to be burdened with extra responsibility, no extra money or benefits.  Eventually, the gas station down the hill from us was hiring at a hiring hourly rate than I was receiving from them.  I ended up leaving and going back to school.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure",But you have the well-being of three children to worry about.  The older gentleman knows how to take care of himself. Communication and Copmarative religious studies.<|endoftext|>
Others,*comparative.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I'm thinking about going back for my masters but no I am not still in school.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","That's excellent.  I don't think you should take on this boss's emotions as a reason to stay with a job you're burning out on.  I think you should take the small step of looking at what's out there, and maybe having a few interviews.  You could try explaining to your boss that you need benefits for the kids.  I would be surprised if he did not understand that. And if he does not understand that, well, you will know exactly who you work for, and that will be additional impetus to move on.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Then I would think he would understand even more.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self-esteem is that true?<|endoftext|>
Question,do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better?<|endoftext|>
Others,remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren't right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn't want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn't mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it's better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn't stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You are very welcome!<|endoftext|>
Question,Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don't I don't see it as a problem :).<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it's not legal in my country :).<|endoftext|>"
Information,I am in the UK. It's sort of a grey area ... police won't really do anything but you can't buy it over the counter.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot.  The US seems to be really strict on it tho.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,They were but I didn't pay much attention :) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that's all .<|endoftext|>
Others,If I were in London or a major city I'd vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don't have one :D. I vote for local councillors tho.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I like Khan :).<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I like him too lol.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,"yeah ... heh I don't go there, being half English and half Irish :). But yeah that was so my era ..<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Anyway nice to meet you and all that but I think we have sort of fulfilled the criteria :D.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,you too! Can you press quit first cos I can't from this end for some reason :).<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I understand. Is this related to the pandemic or is it something separate? I am sure that the pandemic has not helped, though!<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Oh I can certainly relate to that one! I've gained a stone and a half in the last year. All this sitting around is not good for us!<|endoftext|>
Others,Sometimes just having someone to talk to who knows how you are feeling can be really helpful I think.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Can you make a list of all the  things that you hope will be better next year so you can tick them off one by one?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well, the first and third one are out of your control really but you could make a start on the first one today if you liked :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,I can understand that. Perhaps you could join an exercise class or similar?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I took an aerobics class once. It was quite fun and it was good exercise.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well, it's maybe not the best time to be taking on a financial commitment but have you ever considered adopting a dog? Good company and good exercise.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Ah I have two - they are wonderful company. Alas you can't really walk with them though :).<|endoftext|>
Others,Pets are great like that. Do you perhaps have a neighbour whose dog you could walk if you can't get one of your own?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions",It's a great way to make new friends too! Would you consider doing some voluntary work whilst you are out of work?<|endoftext|>
Others,I think it would be a really worthwhile thing to do and you would get to meet new people too. I hope I have been able to help you a little!<|endoftext|>
Others,"You are very welcome, it was my pleasure. Have a great day!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Hello, how can I help you today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1-10 how well are you understanding your course material?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's completely normal you haven't made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Would you say your problems start with your roommates?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self-manage without the right resources.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Ah and then they started rolling in, correct?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions,Question","Me too, unfortunately for us, universities don't seem t have the same sentiments. For starters, I think it would benefit you to eliminate the more closer problems: your roommates. Have you tried talking to them?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma. Are you currently working?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hello, how are you today?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","I know how you feel, I have often felt anxiety before a job interview. What makes you feel that you are unprepared?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses? That could possibly speed up your preparation time.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation. Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days. Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident. Do you think any of these ideas might help?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Be confident in your abilities. You are the right person for the job, and if the interviewer does not see that, it is their failing, not yours. You will do great.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Excellent. I am very happy to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<|endoftext|>
Others,You are quite welcome. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Have a great day.<|endoftext|>
Others,I am doing pretty well. There's a beautiful sunset outside right now. How are you?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",Yep. Me too. My dad just got sick and I was worried out of my mind waiting for his test results to come back. Thankfully they were negative. Is there anything else you've been worried about?<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you working right now?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you have a backup plan if you get laid off?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I see. Do you have anyone who would be willing to offer you support if you needed it, like your parents?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",It might be worth talking to them ahead of time. I'm sure they would understand. Lots of people are in a similar situation right now.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Yes. I live in California, which is kind of strict.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"Yes, and are you somewhere where you can walk or exercise a bit? I always feel better if I can move around...dance...something active.

We met up and talked about it, but she was out of hand and I quit the friendship. But I think the best thing is to have some time alone and think about it.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I know right.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",Think about all the good and bad stuff that has happened between you two and see if it's worth keeping this friendship. Don't really let your emotions take over. Think logically with a clear head.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope this helped. You guys may see each other and forget all about it. Laugh about it later.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I think it has been tearing people apart because of everyone's different beliefs.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I also think staying in the house too long has really made us bored and tired and kind of out of our minds lol.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope so. I'm starting kind of a new life and I want to get on with it. I think we all want to get on with our lives.<|endoftext|>

Others,Thank you!!! Have a good one!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm so sorry to hear that you are about to lose your job.  That sounds very stressful.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds very difficult that things are not openly discussed. It sounds like you want to be proactive which is good though.<|endoftext|>

Question,Is there anyone you can contact who has been in a similar situation to help you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's great that you are so willing to try different options to move forward.  Perhaps a family member may help?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Just from chatting with you, I can see why you are anxious.  Have you tried any deep breathing techniques.  They are often helpful when dealing with stress.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Praying is also an excellent idea.  My friends and I prayed all day long for each other during a difficult exam that I previously had failed and had to retake.  That day everyone passed the exam.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",My grandmother always encouraged me by saying there is always someone who has it rougher. Things can be really hard but you can do it.  You are working hard and trying so hard.<|endoftext|>

Out of curiosity; what work were you doing and how long were you doing it? Sorry about that.  computer glitch.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,14 years?  Wow.  That is really impressive.  It is a very difficult field and it take serious talent to work in IT.  Takes real talent and brainpower to work in IT.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So I also take it that not doing it now must feel like you lost part of yourself as well besides the financial risk.  Double whammy.<|endoftext|>
Question,This is a large cross to bear. So what do you think your next steps are going to be?<|endoftext|>
Question,May I throw some ideas out at you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It sounds like your really down right now about your job, family, and your home.  It sounds like from what you have mentioned finding work would likely be the best goal to work on right now.  What are your thoughts?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,IT right now is highly marketable line of work.  Given the need for networking and teleconferencing right now you are in demand.  And 14 years experience you probably have a competitive advantage in the job market. What do you think your odds of finding a new job are from 0% to 100% right now?  I'd bet pretty high.  What do you think?<|endoftext|>
Question,What's on your mind?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm really sorry to hear that. When did this happen?<|endoftext|>
Information,There's nothing that can prepare you for unexpected tragedies like this. We just have to deal with them as they come.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","It sounds like you're sticking close to your friend, although it doesn't feel like its helping. It's my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn't always an option. The most important thing you can do for her is just to be there for her and allow her to feel however she needs to feel right now.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Of course. These things are tough to face on your own, so you did the right thing by reaching out. I know you want to be there for your friend as much as possible, and I think that will help you to move through grief at the same time, but just be mindful to not overextend yourself too much. You have to be there for yourself too.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You too, and best wishes.<|endoftext|>"
Question,How are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I am glad to hear that I am fine as well. How can I help you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am sorry to hear that. How can I help you deal with the bullies? Can you stand up to them in a safe way?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I understand your concern, but I feel you have to tell them that you do not deserve to be bullied and they need to stop now.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Do you need any more advice on this matter or do you have any other concerns? The bully is the problem, not you. Do you have anyone who can stand up to them with you for support?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have your fiance approach them with you so you are safe. Be strong and firm and do this in a very public area if possible so you have witnesses. Do you have a meeting place where you feel safe?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I hope this is all behind you soon so you can feel better.<|endoftext|>
Question,When will this meeting take place?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Please take care and stay safe. Are you nervous?<|endoftext|>

Question,I am ok.  Been a busy day.  More importantly your upset; what is going on?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You mentioned that she died a while back.  Has something stirred up the sadness recently?<|endoftext|>
Question,Oh.  The anniversary.   You made it clear you were close to her. Tell me about her.  What was she like? What did she mean to you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,She gave you a lot of meaning and filled your time fondly.  I am taking it that after she passed you probably felt empty and lately it has been getting worse?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I can understand that.  My best friend died a few years ago and he was like my brother.  Still does feel empty not having him around.<|endoftext|>
Question,I take it that the loss was sudden and it was a shock to your system.    So how have you been managing the sadness and grief since it happened?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like your family is being supportive of you and you have a network.  It seems to me that you really put a great deal of mental energy and fortitude into taking care of yourself. Is there anything else that could help you get thru this rough patch you can think of?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I can think of a few.  Physical activity even walking really helps people who are feeling down.  But it does not work for everyone.  I also know there are grief support groups but I do not know if they are open with the pandemic and everything.  I also know that there are a lot of mental health services available for professional counselling if things are too much.  I also heard that having things to do to fill your schedule helps like work or small projects to fill the day up.  What do you think would work best for you?<|endoftext|>
Question,What things to you like to do that would benefit you to fill your schedule?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,So you have a toolbox of things you can do to stay busy to get you through this.  You seem to have solved this problem for yourself. That is a strength right there.<|endoftext|>
Others,Anytime.  Stay safe and live well.  -KJ the nurse.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,I have a group with my elementary school friends.. we hang out in zoom because we all are spread out across the globe.. some times.. it;s fun as we can share a lot of memories..<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",this happens very common in friend groups. it is understandable that you feel upset. this happens very common in friend groups. it is understandable that you feel upset. did u have an argument?<|endoftext|>
Question,what do u argue about.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"its hard when you care about someone to not question there actions, when you feel you know whats best for them. is that how u r feeling?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Information,Providing Suggestions","you feel uncomfortable because your friends are ignoring your feelings? sometimes, people hide when they are confronted. i think it may be beneficial to give your friends some time, before attempting to speak with them again. maybe you can spend time with your family while you are waiting for them to cool down.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Providing Suggestions",do u have any friends that are still talking to you? i think you should spend time with the people that make you feel wanted.<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,"As you message me, I can feel your pain. It seems you aren't sure what to do with these feelings.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information","I understand. I have been in a similar situation myself. Heartbreak is one of the hardest feelings to go through, but I believe in you and your strength. From what I've seen before, surrounding yourself with good friends helps quite a bit.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I understand feeling that way. Something I do when I am feeling pain is taking deep breaths. Inhale, exhale. Could you do that for me?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","I am sorry to hear that. I believe in you, things will be better with time. Would you like to continue chatting?<|endoftext|>"
Others,Okay. Are you excited for the upcoming holidays?<|endoftext|>
Others,That sounds fun! Is the new year party with friends? Or is it a family affair?<|endoftext|>
Others,That is fun! Friends and family are the most wonderful cure for the blues. What types of games will you be playing?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","Musical chairs is one of my favorites. I remember when I was going through a hard time, my friends took me out to dinner and we spent all night together. It was very fun and helped me a lot. I think it's really great that you have that party planned!<|endoftext|>"
Question,"How are you feeling now, my friend?<|endoftext|>"

Others,I am so happy to hear that. I hope you have a great day every day!<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings","Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question",I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?<|endoftext|>
Information,"I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :). You have every right to feel the way you do though. It's a scary time but know that things will be okay.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume.

"Others,Question",Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,He should not be treating you that way when you've known one another so long!<|endoftext|>

Others,Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex.<|endoftext|>
Question,They all took his side? Not one took yours?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class .. that was a great way to meet new people.<|endoftext|>
Others,There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you?<|endoftext|>

Others,he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,No you did not! Please don't think like that.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information",I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information",I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Self-disclosure","And yet here we are :P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No-one will be judging you.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?<|endoftext|>
Others,The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,"Ok, it's a good thing that he stopped. What he did was bad though, no denying that.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Maybe he feels ashamed about watching porn, that's why he tried to hide. I would hate it too if my partner watches porn.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Other than that, is there anything else?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I think you should be firm, let him know how much you hate what he did and how much it affected you. I think it's a serious issue, him not being honest with you over trivial things. At the same time, breaking up  without any other issues is kind of not optimal considered you;ve dated for 1 year.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Did you see any changes in behavior after that?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"you should tell him that, and let him the problem is you feel disrespected when he watches porn while dating you.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I am so sorry to hear that, you are not oversensitive at all. Trust me, any normal girls would feel the same.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Breaking up over this is a pity, however, he doesn't seem trustworthy after everything you told me. How about give him some time, 3-6 months and see if he changes at all. If not or if you really think he's not worth your time, go ahead and cut tie with him. you deserve someone who respects you, it doesn't take that much either.<|endoftext|>"

"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Besides the basic hand washing and hygiene, I don't think we can prepare anymore for it. I think at this point, we will either get it or not until they figure if the vaccine will work or not. It is a very scary thing.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Someone else would have collapsed already. Do you go outside a lot?<|endoftext|>
Others,Maybe that's why your depression got worse. We need the sun and fresh air to feel better.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","I understand it's hard for a person like you. However, as I said, from my own experience, staying indoor for a long period does more harm than good. You don't have to go far, even just out in your backyard to have some sunlight as the first step is good enough.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Just take one step at a time, I believe you can do it as long as you put your mind in. If you don't get close to anyone and wear a mask, you should be fine.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"it's pretty bad here too but as long as you avoid crowded place, you'll be fine.<|endoftext|>"
Others,we have 3 vaccines candidates now so there's hope.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know what you mean, in-person is always better than over the phone. I understand why you would feel this way.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel anxiety about this whole COVID-19 epidemic?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Oh well I understand your concern then.  As a son or daughter it is certainly reasonable to be concerned about your parents especially as they grow older.  I have a similar situation with my own mother.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well first of all, you have to take care of yourself because if you don't you can't help them.  So just take a moment to close your eyes and take some deep breaths and realize you stressing is probably going to make them stress.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well if you can get some concrete info such as from the CDC and John Hopkins showing case counts in your area.  Show them graphs so they can visually see the impact.  Also if you can get a hold of their doctor yourself, see if you can convince them to give your parents a call, say to check on them and give them some advice.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Don't get absorbed in the numbers, it can drive you crazy.  Also if you are using social media like twitter and getting inundated with info, remember a lot of it is fake.  I would suggest limiting exposure for a little while just to get you fixed a little bit, if that makes sense.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Not particularly social media because it open to everyone, just pick and choose where you choose to get info from.  The CDC is a great resource as well as the John Hopkins site which has been tracking since the beginning.   Everybody has a couple of news outlets they trust, use those.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"First of all you are not alone.  but don't let them see you anxious for sure.  You can also show them if they can how to do video visits.  You can do that all the time, even phone calls every day.  It means a lot.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,I understand that you are feeling like your professors don't see you as a person with feelings. What happened to make you feel this way?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's hard to feel like they are treating you like a number when you are working so hard.  Have you talked to them about it?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I had a similar experience in my college days. It was very difficult to have so much pressure to succeed and feel so alone.  You can do though because you are working hard and want to succeed.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I see you are anxious about this when talking to you, but have you thought about getting some support from other students in your position?<|endoftext|>"

Others,That is reassuring that it worked before for you and  can work again.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,College can be quite a change from the protective atmosphere of home.  Have you tried any support groups or religious groups for encouragement?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I was a  part of a religious group in college and they were very supportive even praying for me on exam days.  I felt they helped me with my success by planting seeds of positive feedback to me.<|endoftext|>
Others,Are you starting to feel better about the situation?<|endoftext|>

Question,"I am sorry to hear that, I used to have sleeping issues as well. What do you do in the hour leading up to bed time and what do you do in bed before you sleep?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",I made a rule in my house where we cannot use any technology 1 hour before bed time. We read a book for example. That might be something you can start to implement in your schedule. Cutting out technology 1 hour before bed time.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Don't feel bad, we all do it in this day and age.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I also have a playlist of what's known as ""white noise"". Think of rain falling on the windows, a stream of water flowing, birds tweeting. This is what I listen to while I'm lying in bed waiting to go to sleep. You could try this as well.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Sometimes sleep issues are not about you doing something wrong, just about how you can set your mind in a better place. No 100%, you shouldn't take pills unless its absolutely necessary, and I don't think it is right now. I think you can do this without pills.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"No problem at all, its my pleasure. I believe you can as well :).<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yes about 2 years ago I started to have sleep issues. I noticed the phone was the first thing I picked up after waking up, and the last thing I put down. It is terrible what technology and social media does to us. Yes about 2 years ago I started to have sleep issues.

"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","Gosh you've been busy :). I am sorry to hear that though - I know how much it hurts when you split with someone, especially if it was not consensual. It's a lousy time of year for it too, isn't it?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is a defeatist way to talk! Just because a couple of relationships fail does not mean that you will never be able to find happiness.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have been in that position too. I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I hear you on that one too! It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I hear  you saying that they are not really effective, is that true?<|endoftext|>"
Others,Okay .. I hope you reported him!!<|endoftext|>
Question,I understand that as well .. I am on medication for it. A dog is a wonderful thing to have! Do you feel that it has helped you?<|endoftext|>

"Question,Reflection of feelings","Is part of that the weight gain from pregnancy?   And what sort of mental health challenges are you having?   Both of these problems are very common for new mothers. I'm sorry to hear you are going through this, it sounds like a very tough time for you.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Oh that is understandable.   I am a mother, and remember worrying about the same thing.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I can tell you from personal experience that loose skin, stretch marks, and loosening of ""other parts"" do all self correct with time.  You will feel better about your body again when they do.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I was fortunate not to experience depresion.  But I totally went through self doubt, wondering if I was being a good enough mother, and feeling ""not up to"" the task....it's the hardest job in the world, being a mom, and so exhausting the first while. Have you spoken to your doctor about how depressed you are feeling?<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Question,Providing Suggestions","Antidepressants can take a couple of weeks to kick in, I am on them too;  I hope you will find them helpful.   It's hard waiting for them to work! Do you have someone helping you with the baby or are you a single mom? The best advice I can share from my experience as a new mom was find someone to give you breaks.   Whether that be a partner, a friend, a family member, or even a baby sitter if that's possible.   Its important to take time to rest and recharge an nurture yourself, whether that be a nap, a bubble bath, a walk or whatever has made you feel good in the past.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Oh that's a long shift...I'm glad you have someone at home to help when he can.   It may seem impossible but you are stronger than you think...you've got this. hey that's great that you had a road trip!   And yes it's hard to trust someone else with our wee ones...but so necessary both for you and for your marriage too.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I have one other suggestion before I go, have you any mother and baby groups in your area?   Something you may want to research.   It's been a pleasure speaking with you, you are so welcome.   Know that as hard as it is, these feelings can be a normal experience for a new mother, and you will get through it.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel that you are being put in danger by the actions of your room-mate?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I can totally understand how you feel.  I absolutely hate how some people are pretending that the pandemic is not real and they do not need to worry.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Do not worry, your fears are totally grounded. Some people really just need to grow up and get educated.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anyone at your college who could help you with this? Perhaps move you into a single room?<|endoftext|>
Others,Yes they certainly have. They seem to think that it will never happen to them and do not realise that they are putting others at risk.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Is it possible for you to take some time off school?<|endoftext|>

"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",I think we all have one of those friends I know I had one who no matter what happened she had something better happen or something worse. I mean the only thing you can do is make a choice is her friendship worth anything toxic that comes along with her? Do you know what causes her to be that away? Sometimes there is an underlining reason or condition.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh, that's not good.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question",I hate to say it but maybe it is time to make a choice if her friendship is worth the problems it brings. Maybe it is just time for a break from each other while you make up your mind. Was there anything else I could help you with?<|endoftext|>

"Information,Providing Suggestions","Yeah i get that, something will happen with my kid and i think, man dad would love to hear that.

Try to take comfort in the fact that she was your go to, She was there for you but she was also trying to make you a better person.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,Gosh I am very sorry to hear that you are struggling to loose weight and it is making you sad. May I ask what you are doing to attempt to loose the weight? I hear cardio is very good for that.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I totally understand. I was the same way over worked and under motivated. I found that mixing in low impact weight work outs was really effective as well as each morning setting out healthy snacks that way i don't have to think about getting something it is already there.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Honestly my top favorite are chocolate covered almonds and sugar snap peas. have you tried lowering your carb and increasing your protein intake?<|endoftext|>

"Reflection of feelings,Question","It's very sad and your emotions will take a toll, but you have to set some goals so you don't fall into a funk. Do you have a good support system? Did he give a reason for the breakup?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Are you telling me he just said ""I am breaking up with you"" then never said why and left?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I think he doesn't know what he wants and thinks the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. It is disrespectful to you. And hurtful. You say you have no support, don't you have friends? Family?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think you might want to join an online support group then. Do you have any goals or aspirations that you are working on apart from your relationship? Because it will be painful to move forward, but if you have some goals, that can help you from falling into a slump.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"You are welcome. I am happily married now, but I had my fair share of breakups. They hurt my self esteem. I had to work hard to not let that happen. And do my best to grieve, but not get stuck there. If a man did not want to be with me, I took it hard as rejection, but in the long run, if he does not want to be with me, I don't want to be with him, but that takes time, and you need friends to encourage you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you. I'm older, been through a LOT of hard knocks. You will be stronger too, right now you are hurting, in time you will see more clearly.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information","He hasn't told you why, so the problem lies in him, not you. So do your best not to be hard on yourself. It is a shock to you now, but he never even communicated this with you over time, and he should have. that's what you want in a partner. If a relationship has problems, you want someone to talk about he problems and work on them and grow as two people. He chose to walk away, that's immature and not what you want in a relationship. That is actually abusive.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","Thank you! You are so very kind! And you are very sweet too, willing to hear the truth! That is an admirable quality!  You deserve a partner willing to work on problems, not a quitter. Do take care of yourself! Find some friends, work hard at that, call old friends too. Just to say hi, call an old aunt or uncle and check in. Find community. That will help you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes! Don't hop into another relationship for a long time, months, even a year. Find out who you are. Be the woman you want to be. I prayed for my husband for a long time. God is good! :D I had a lot of bad ones before him!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you so much!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh I see. You feel as though you don't have any friend's currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It's so hard to see people and keep relationships right now.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's a really hard thing to be going through. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn't have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it's 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings",Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don't want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it's more than just feeling like you don't have any friends?<|endoftext|>
Information,"On most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town! people close by.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Information","Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn't blame myself for. You shouldn't blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it's less awkward to hangout with someone you don't really know.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. You can get comfortable with them before you hangout :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yeah of course! I hope this helps you, and I wish you the best during these weird times :).<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you have been feeling down since the breakup a couple days ago?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I can relate to this heartache as I have gone through similar breakups in my life. The important thing is that we pick ourselves up after something like this.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It can be really hard sometimes! It appears that  you possess the strength and motivation to be able to pick yourself back up. The factthat you are reaching out for help shows you have the motivation and desire to work to get better!<|endoftext|>
Information,Studies indicate that emotions felt immidiately after a breakup eventually subside with time. It is important to take care of yourself in the mean time. Do you have any hobbies?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you like to read? Have you thought about reading self-help books on perhaps depression?<|endoftext|>
Question,Have the books provided you any benefit?<|endoftext|>

Question,What has stopped you from doing this in the past?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am hearing that while you have thought about reaching out for professional help in the past in regaurds to your mental health, you have not felt comfortable enough to do this as this makes you feel a bit anxious or nervous is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I am nervous in situations that are new to me as well so I understand this. Is there something you can do to get past this nervousness so that you fel comfortable seeking out this help?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It sounds like the only way for you to gain that confidence in someone to be able to share your feelings with them, that you will likely need to face that fear in order to make progress, is that right?<|endoftext|>"

Information,Have you thought of taking some sort of refresher or training course? There are quite a few available.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Hmmm well how are your computing skills? That's a great field to be in at the moment.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Well that would be an interesting thing to learn don't you think? Though I don't know much about them myself I must admit.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Question",It would but if you've nothing better to do due to the pandemic it might be worth it. Have you considered registering with employment agencies for temp work?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",Me too. It can be a bit soulless but it does pay the bills when you don't have anything else to do. Anyway I hope that I have been able to help you a little and that you are feeling a little more positive about things?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be.   I'm sorry to hear you're going through that.<|endoftext|>
Question,I can certainly understand that.  Are you working or attending classes from home?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"It's very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time, or a daily routine.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I have been attending school online, and I occasionally make deliveries for my husband and I's small business.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, a daily routine is good for normalizing change.  It's also good for structuring in time to relax and recharge, which you still need even if you aren't currently employed.  Times are still very stressful and uncertain, and that takes an emotional toll no matter who you are.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure,Self-disclosure,Question,Providing Suggestions","I understand being angry about that.  Going to school supposedly is/was a way to take control of one's life, it's no longer the guarantee is once was. I sometimes feel a similar way about my own classes.  I am also in my thirties. But I personally enjoy learning, and would always regret it if I never finished my degree.  We all have our cultural norms that we conform to, whether consciously or unconsciously. Do you find yourself being stymied at the application level or the interview level when it comes to jobs? Maybe having a professional in your career path review your resume would be helpful.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",OK. This is a temporary feeling and it will pass. Please be kind to yourself. What led to you feeling this way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"OK. So you proposed to your girlfriend, but she was seeing another man?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings",And the man you thought was her uncle was her other boyfriend? That is a horrible situation. It's not nice when people lie to you - I've had it happen to me before. You must be feeling very betrayed at the moment.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions","That sounds horrible. I think anyone would be upset with that! I wonder if it was best that this happened before you got married, though - it hurts, but it would have hurt more if she had become your wife. How does it feel if you think about it that way?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,How does your family and friends feel about it? Have you spoken to them?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You must feel as though she has taken advantage of you and your generosity.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings",I think it might be good to talk to people around you who knew you both. I know that it must be difficult because you feel like your pride has been hurt as well as your heart.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you are a very thoughtful and generous partner. I know that others will see that in you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you shopuld now focus on taking care of yourself. Did you neglect anything you need or enjoy to take care of her? Could you do that now?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","I can see how that might make it difficult to trust people. However, not everybody is the same. You sound like a very caring person and there are lots of caring women out there looking for someone just like you. Could you spend some time getting to know more people until you feel like you can trust someone again? Do you have any hobbies you enjoy?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Great! Have you tried joining a book club, where you can discuss books you enjoy with others? That will help take your mind off things and you can meet new people too.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I'm glad. I hope you have a great day and please remember to be kind to yourself.<|endoftext|>
Others,Sure I can.<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you talked to your boss about it?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can understand how you feeling you work extremely hard and get no raise when you deserve it.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,oh wow 15 years? I really believe you need a raise and doing more work now. I honestly think you should bring it up to your boss.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can't believe he has not given you a raise by now.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Just tell him that you need to have a serious talk with him and tell him straight up what is on your mind don't hold it back.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",Yes I know you can do it but that is the only way to solve the situation is by communicating with him. Yes that would help more by bringing in proof to him.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yes just remain calm with him.<|endoftext|>
Others,getting a attitude with him will not help at all.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Don't let this situation get to you so much.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Everything will be ok.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Your welcome i am sure he will give you a raise once you talk to him.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I will be praying that you get the raise because you deserve it.<|endoftext|>
Others,Your most welcome.<|endoftext|>
Others,Merry Christmas to you to!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,What sort of problems were in your past and now?<|endoftext|>
Information,What was happening in your life that made you lose interest?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like that is a lot of reasons to be stressed. Have you spoken to a school counselor?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","I agree it is a lot of pressure, but do not let bad teachers deter you. I would reach out to a school counselor and let them know your situation. Every school must have one. Also, physics is a difficult course to study, but if you chose it, that means you have a very strong mind.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"More reason to speak to a school counselor or school administrator. We need to provide help to students, not have bad teachers deter them.<|endoftext|>"
Information,What made you choose this particular university you are at?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you looked into other Universities for the possibility of transferring.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Just think about what you want in a good university and research from there.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You're welcome I hope you find the perfect university for you.<|endoftext|>
Others,Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
Question,I am okay. What would you like to talk to me about?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you drink when you are at work?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Reflection of feelings","That does sound like it might be a big problem. How are  your employers reacting? It sounds like you have a big problem that needs professional help, would you agree?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I think it is likely to have been noticed though, at least.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I think the best thing would be to be really honest with your employers and ask if you can have time off for professional help.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you employers likely to be sympathetic?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Ah people do love to idly gossip don't they? I've been through that myself. I know it's hard to ignore them but it's best to try.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions",I do not know if they can fire you if you have a legitimate medical problem though. Well you could always shame them if they unfairly fired you.<|endoftext|>
Information,Large corporations are always over concerned about their images. (we have to talk for fifteen minutes :)).<|endoftext|>
"Question,Self-disclosure","naw there's a time thing too :). Anyway, what sort of therapy do you think would be appropriate for you? To be honest, and I mean this sincerely, I've been through it :(.<|endoftext|>"
Information,It can be very expensive though. In my country you can get it for free but there's a long waiting list.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",Heh be grateful :). Are you in the US? Our healthcare system is a little less rigid here I think (UK).<|endoftext|>
"Others,Information",Ah you are a long way away from me. I hope that you do manage to sort out your problems though and definitely do talk to your employers. Ah it's quite nice here. We pay for healthcare out of our taxes so it's free at source.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Gossipy people are the worst. Just remind yourself that they all have skeletons in their closets too.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Well anyway, I hope I have been able to offer your  some useful advice. I wish you all of the very best in the future.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others",(can you press quit first and do the survey as I am not able to do it from my side). Well thanks :).<|endoftext|>
Others,Hello how are you.<|endoftext|>
Question,Great how is everything going for you.<|endoftext|>
Question,Why do you feel isolated?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I completely  understand. I don't worked at a school and the teachers did not receive much support. Is that what is making you stuggle at work?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is it the lack of support at the school that is causing you to struggle?<|endoftext|>
Question,Sorry I asked about the isolation and you mentioned the reason was the work. So im just trying to confirm your lack of support at school is the reason for your struggle. Does the feeling of isolation stem from that?<|endoftext|>
Others,Understandable.Do they have any kind of help groups at your school?<|endoftext|>
Information,Is there something you have in mind that might help your situation and theyre not listening?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Agreed with 20 some students after repeatedly trying with a student you cannot keep stopping the lecture to discipline. Of course there should be some help in place.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ive seen this first hand and teachers really have their hands full. I know most parents are busy, but have you tried to connect with the parents maybe they can step in and talk to their children.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,There are also several community groups with different kids of occupations. Ive seen multiple ones for teachers helping each other by sharing their own methods. That might help with some ideas.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,No problem. I hope you find some better ideas. You are not alone and remember you have one of the hardest jobs out there!<|endoftext|>
Others,Same to you!<|endoftext|>
Question,How so?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have done that myself, but being self aware is an advantage not many people have. How long has this been happening?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,These are not the best times... but lets dig deeper to the root of this new behavior.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I have been down that road myself, and I didn't have anyone to help me. But luckily, you have resources and support. Help me understand what makes you drink? Is it a trigger like stress? Or just a habit?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What do you do for work?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Oh I can definitely understand your reasoning. I am not justifying your behavior, but at least we see now, it goes hand in hand. The corporate dinner parties and cocktail hours.. it is usually much deeper than the surface.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Usually when I find myself going off the deep end, I can reign it back by realizing that the power lies in me. My control to use a relaxer like a cocktail hour, to just be that. It does not have to be a contest. It should make you feel good, then leave it. But if you cannot control it, try and de-stress another way like baths or massages. It sounds like you are pretty self aware, which is a great short cut to this dilemma. You can use this to your advantage, and make more conscious choices to better your life.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"That is great, please share with me your findings.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It is easy to get side tracked by ego especially in that field. Try to stay focused and remember why you are there. You aren't there to impress Jim. You are there to make money and achieve your goals. As long as your eyes stay on the goal, the rest will follow.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,You are a strong individual and I am here for you. You inspire me to do better!!<|endoftext|>
Others,"You inspire me because rather than allowing it to consume you, you are actively seeking help. That is very commendable.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way. Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track. Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week. Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure,Information","Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that. You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God. That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Information","I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess. Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"It is only one more month of your life. If you buckle down, it will be over and done with before you know it. And I assure you, you will look back in pride at your accomplishments!<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Not much in life is easy or free, if we keep working little by little, as time passes, you real a lot of rewards, in fact, you will reap rewards of finishing this thesis for YEARS even decades. It is a great goal and a worthy one to keep at.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","I commend you for doing the thesis and I also know it can get weary as time passes, but with some goals on paper a visit to the ADVISOR (hee hee) will set you up right for continued success. You are very welcome. Have a blessed evening!!<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure",that's really bad. even I was also in the same situation.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","To be honest i was not completely came out it since it was 3 years but now i somehow getting better i tried to divert myself from the thoughts engage myself with other friends spend more time with my family like that. try to divert yourself, keep yourself busy, spend more time with family, try to minimize the usage of mobile.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,yeah I could understand your feelings right now.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,yeah its really hard to handle this state of mind but we need to.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I don't know but some girls were playing with a guys intense feelings.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I think the best way is to move on.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,make her feel like without her your life will be better.<|endoftext|>
Others,revenge her with your success and positive attitude in front of she you need to much more happy.<|endoftext|>
Others,that's great!! happy beginning of new life.<|endoftext|>
Others,oh no i'm sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs?<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand how you feel, it's tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others",I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it's very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated.<|endoftext|>
Others,"That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel.<|endoftext|>"
Others,you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,yeah I have a full time job and working on mturk at night. Covid has hit me financially too.<|endoftext|>
Others,we all face different pressure and have to find ways around it.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Please stay positive, go out more and exercise more frequently.<|endoftext|>"
Others,you too.<|endoftext|>
Others,Not too bad!It looks like a lovely day out.<|endoftext|>
Others,Well.make sure you're bundled up and warm!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Sounds cozy. Glad to hear that you're staying safe indoors!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Definitely! How are you dealing with the pandemic? It's been a long year.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I'm not too bad, but cases are also going up here in California. Luckily, my family and I haven't gotten sick.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I think that's true for a lot of states since cases seem to be going up everywhere, unfortunately. What are your plans for the holidays?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,We're planning on camping in the desert. That's a good idea to save money. How do you plan on saving money?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Those are all really good ideas, and it sounds like you know what's really important! It's definitely been a tough year, but it's also good to look ahead and plan for the future.<|endoftext|>"
Others,It's been great chatting with you too! Hope you and your loved ones stay safe out there!<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question,Self-disclosure","I understand it could be better. What is going on? My day could be better too sometimes, it may help to talk about it.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Information",It sounds like you are really worried and have anxiety over the qurantine. From my experience it has helped tremendously to take a few deep breaths.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I also have been worried about getting it and passing it on. I have been taking extra precautions to stay home and wash my hands often to try and prevent it.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions",That is so difficult that you are concerned  and upset that you can't see her. In my experience I've used video chat to help me get through hard times when I couldn't see my loved ones in person.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's really hard, but I think you have it in you to keep doing your best and staying safe.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I'm happy you were able to talk to me, I know talking about how I'm feeling helps me feel better sometimes.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Hey :).<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",I was in a similar situation a short while back I can understand if you feel anxious and stressed. Was it due to the pandemic?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So if I understand the anxiety of you losing your job is increased because you also have to give your wife the news?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,If where you live has some form of unemployment insurance it may be a good time to apply for it if your comfortable with that since you are aware your job is coming to an end.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It's completly understandable that telling your wife is additionally difficult since it's life effecting news and you are probably worried about the effect the news will have on your wife.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,In my case I am still currently in school and lack credentials but I've managed to find some online work that is getting me by.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You may want to budget relevant areas of yur spending ahead of time so your savings will go longer but Isuggest not to the point that it effects your mental well being. Also if your on good terms maybe get references.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",I don't drive so my options were limited to avoid riding the bus I do recommend getting out of you living space other ways if you work online but its all right. I think with that kind of connection with your boss especially with your job loss being circumstantial you should have a really good starting point.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Information,Self-disclosure,Question",It does have benefits you save money on transportation costs for example :). That is actually along the lines of what I'm doing on the low end of the totem pole Not the high paying jobs but the basic and intermediate seems to be a fair bit available. I don't male much but Ihave flexible hours and still finishing my degree. How are you currently feeling about your situation with a little bit of a plan in place?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others",Maybe if you get your basic ideas together where your satisfied with it it will ease some of the difficulty of talking to your wife. I apologise we had the same idea.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope your day goes great as well.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions","If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,.I would try it.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Try one thing at a time so you are not overwhelmed.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I agree. You are not alone.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Hang in there. It is great that you are in school.<|endoftext|>
Others,I enjoyed chatting with you. Take care.<|endoftext|>
Others,Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
Others,Hello.<|endoftext|>
Question,"I am good, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What is making you upset tonight?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Just to make sure I understand, you got a bad grade in one of your classes and your grade dropped below an A and you are upset about it.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you talked to your professor about the reason for the grade you got that dropped your grade below an A? Often it helps to understand what we did wrong in order to know what we can do to improve.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you reached out to your advisor to speak with them on the situation? Often times your advisor is able to help with advice on what to do in this type of situation.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I had a similar situation last semester where I held an A in my class all semester long until the end when it dropped to a B+ so I comletely understand the frustration here.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know it is extremely difficult to do that when you really want to keep your grades up, but I know you can get through this!<|endoftext|>"
Others,You will do a great job!'.<|endoftext|>
Others,"You are very welcome! If you ever need anything else, feel free to chat again!<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're very welcome! I am glad I was able to help!<|endoftext|>
Question,No problem! How are you doing? How can I help you today?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I am very sorry to hear that. Facing pay cuts at work can be a very stressful situation. Are there situations or moments that specifically make you feel like this is going to happen? Or are you just feeling a general sense of anxiety and fear it might happen?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","I can definitely understand why that would be difficult.  Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances. One thing that helps me out in those moments, is to remember that there are things in the world and life that I can control, and others that I can't control.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It seems like the best thing you can do at the moment is try your best to do the best you can at your job. If there will be paycuts, you might not be able to prevent it. But at least you will know that you gave a valiant effort.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I just wanted to remind you to remember, anxiety about something that has not happened yet is not always helpful to yourself. By focusing directly on what you can do, you can make sure you are prepared for anything negative coming your way.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Is there anything else you need help with?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Good, I am very glad to hear that. I am wishing you the best in the future and definitely feel free to contact me if you need support again!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Do you need any help with any other questions? Otherwise, there is a quit button on the side.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome. Don't hesitate to contact me again! Have  a great day.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything you want to talk about?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Yeah, I've definitely felt that way...especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yep, for me it's kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just ""take a break"" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy...have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I've been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I'm feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can't see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","Force yourself at first, then the ""body in motion, stays in motion"" law will take over. :). All I know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"One of the things I've noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives...you know before it would be like, ""I'm looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend."" So, when you aren't planning things and don't have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I'm sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I've been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn't because we grow out of them, it's quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.<|endoftext|>"

Isort the season and all the expectations and memories of exacerbated the loss for me. Do you think that might be making you feel worse? Have you considered that You must be beautiful/handsome for her to be attracted to you.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"I was really lonely after my breakup too.  I had to make myself spend time with other people that cared about me like friends and family.  Even though I kind of just wanted to stay sad making myself be around other people that reminded me of the good, perfect and lovable things about myself made me feel better and gave me hope. Maybe easing your lonliness would give you some relief?<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,It's normal to feel the way you do as  you sort out what happened and how to go forward.<|endoftext|>
Information,"If you dont feel like being around people, what really helped me was reminding myself of the good things about myself. Sometimes I even made a list so I didn't forget.  And staying distracted sometimes helped too.  Experts say coming up with some goal or project really helps.<|endoftext|>"

Ypu are not alone. I know that nothing I say can take away your pain or make it not have happened, but I care that you have these feelings and I care about you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"you are welcome.  i hope you feel supported and encouraged.  I know this will get better for you.  take care of and love yourself, friend. you are worth it.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"and one last thing that worked for me was when I was really fixated on how perfect my ex was, i'd make a list of why they weren't and why we weren't good together.  It made me think in a more balanced way.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"yeah, it did work.  even when all could see was how great my ex was i could at least see why we didn't work and i wanted us both to be happy so writing that stuff helped me keep it in perspective.  Its been a privilege listening to you . i'm wishing you all good things.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Maybe you could help her feel more comfortable around you, as that is what I would do :).<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It seems like you two don't share a lot of chemistry. But then again, you can't afford to let her leave.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"No i don't think thats a good idea, if you are still able to change her mind. Maybe try to talk it out with her in a calm setting.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Information","Yeah, if she is non-confrontational that means that you will have to initiate it. Because she won't and she will end up leaving.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"yeah but you can't really take such a gamble tbh.  And why did she buy it, is it because she wanted you to live in it?<|endoftext|>"
Others,We were supposed to chat for at least 10 messages each i think.<|endoftext|>
Information,"It takes a while i think like a week, but i am not sure.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Yeah, if she wanted to leave she would've done so long ago in my opinion. bye.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you mind me asking what it is that caused you to reach out to someone for support?<|endoftext|>
Others,"I'm not aware of there being a phone number for you to call. This is a task that is supposed to be done via Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. I believe you're supposed to tell me what the problem is. Then, I will help you through it as best as I can.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That sounds good!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm so sorry to hear that. Take your time!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Oh my goodness. I am so incredibly sorry that all of this happened to you. I can tell that you are completely overwhelmed with emotions right now.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","I don't believe that you did anything wrong whatsoever. Sometimes, really unfair things happen to really good people. I can't even imagine how hard this must be, but I would try to look at it in a positive way. I know that losing your best friend and your fiancé must be devastating, but at least you now know that your fiancé is someone who you most certainly probably don't want to spend the rest of your life with. I've been cheated on myself, believe it or not, and it was my daughter's father and my best friend. I can't believe how similar our stories are. I'm not even kidding! I refused to get back together with him (we were engaged at one time as well) and because I refused to get back together with him, he got my best friend pregnant and they are now together and recently had a second child. He has completely forgotten that our daughter exists.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","I think I would start by putting your own health first and getting yourself tested to make sure that you haven't contracted anything from your fiancé. I know this will be incredibly hard, but I wouldn't want to see you getting sick and suffering as a result of his infidelity. No, we were not married. We were together for almost 7 years and engaged at one point, but I broke it off after he cheated on me. He cheated on me several times. It's the worst feeling in the world.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I would be scared, too. However, it's better to act now because to my knowledge, the sooner that you find out and treat it, the better the chances are of you treating it. There are a lot of new medications out there that can be used to treat HIV and AIDS.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",I know that their first child is a girl. I'm not sure if their second is a girl or a boy. I haven't spoken to him in several years. I found out through a friend about their second child. We haven't spoken at all since I found out about the first one. I have been tested for all STDs because I was cheated on. All of mine came back negative. All they did when I got tested was bloodwork. Have you thought about reaching out to a therapist or counselor who could help you to work through your feelings and everything that you're dealing with?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Self-disclosure","I am so incredibly sorry that you have to deal with all of this at all but especially at the start of the holiday season. My heart absolutely breaks for you. Yes, we have a daughter. He spent the first eight years of her life in prison. I gave her the choice as to whether or not she wanted to get to know him. He had plenty of opportunities to speak to her and chose not to call or show up when he was supposed to. The last thing she said about him was, ""All he does is lie to me and break promises. I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore."".<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I'm a great mother and I always put my daughter's feelings first. She made the decision not to see or speak to her father. Him and my now ex-best friend are on drugs and don't have custody of their own children. It's in my daughter's best interest that she doesn't know him. Yes, we are both in therapy. It helps immensely. I know that you weren't the one who cheated, but I would still highly recommend talking to someone about what happened. This is going to be very hard to get through. Again, I am incredibly sorry that you are going through all of this. Our chat session will only last for a total of about 30 minutes. This is meant to be a one-time task, unfortunately.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others,Others","I never did drugs either. My daughter's father did. He still does, and so does my best friend. They lost custody of their kids. I have custody of my daughter. Anyway, I hope that you eventually become more open to talking to a therapist on an ongoing basis. I hope you have a Happy Thanksgiving.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Oh, wow. I didn't know that you were pregnant. I hope that you and your baby are okay! I think you will be a great parent anyway! Best of luck to you.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Have you tried tutor service at school? They usually provide free of charge or very cheap.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It must be frustrated for you.<|endoftext|>
Others,How about talking to your professors about that you don't understand and how they can help?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"don't be too harsh on yourself. We all struggle in life. As long as we find an appropriate solution, I believe you will get better. Of course, it's their job after all.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I feel you. it's scary when everyone seems to do fine but you struggle. However, others struggle silently too, they just like you don't tell anyone.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"If you hesitate to talk to the professors, try their teaching assistants. They tend to be more friendly.<|endoftext|>"
Others,you can also ask your friends to form a study group.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"yes, and maybe you will understand parts that some of them don't.<|endoftext|>"

Others,"no problem, I'm glad I could be some help.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What are you contemplating for?<|endoftext|>
Question,why do you think so?<|endoftext|>
Others,How about joining a club at school to know more people?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you're stuck with your roommate but she doesn't care about you?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Everyone feels that, and it's totally normal. Don't be too harsh on yourself.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Reflection of feelings","Why don't you do something on your own? Read a book, do some crafts? I don't think you should do that. Who knows how next year's gonna look like? It might be even worse.<|endoftext|>"
Question,How about doing video call with your friends at home?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I totally feel you, I feel stressed out and very uncertain throughout this pandemic. You are not alone.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Exactly, I do virtual happy hour with my friends every month.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Self-disclosure","Not only that, when you feel lonely, text your friends and share it with them or your family. Oh I am too busy to do that once a week. All of us are actually.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I don't think so. Maybe they are waiting for you to say first and give you advice, they have more experience after all.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"if that's the case, you can use this chance to be there for her. I think talking to your mom will help you both.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Sounds like a great plan. I believe you can overcome this together.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Yes, right now I'm trying to teach myself one day at a time mindset.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That's the right mindset. I 'm glad I could be some help.<|endoftext|>
Others,you too.<|endoftext|>
Question,Where does your anger stem from ?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Its ok to disagree with people about topics but you need to figure out why it triggers so much anger which turns to hate.<|endoftext|>
Question,How have you been victimized by black people? When those events happen how did that make you feel.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I see I too have had my issues with other races. A few bad instances do not make represent a whole race though. There are also black males who have been robbed and jumped by white people that does not mean all white males are bad. It does seem that you have had alot of unfortunate events with black males. That still does not mean that all black people are bad and why should innocent people pay for things others have done. Do.you have to walk home from work or can you drive. Also have you reported any of these events to the police.<|endoftext|>
Others,I understand have you ever thought about if that black man that raped your wife was just getting even with the white race because his wife or maybe even him was raped repeatedly by white supremists.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,My suggestion would be to get out of the area if is just triggering your anger. Are you able to move to another area?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would suggest for your mental health when the weather is better to move and until then I would avoid areas that can potentially be dangerous and also don't walk home after dark. Also you need to keep seeking council for you anger and racial feelings. I would suggest when you feel very angry to take a deep breath think will your actions help or hurt the situation.  To help with racial issues I would like you to sit and talk to black victims who have been victimized by white people in violent crimes.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,If you follow my advice I think you will see a great improvement. Your willingness to seek advice and ability to identify that you have a problem is a big first step all you got to do now is put the solutions into practice.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Church is always a great idea. I think church would be very helpful. Maybe someday you should even consider going to a predominantly black church.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Maybe you should try it out maybe meeting some good black people there would ease your hate against black people and also help your experience in the neighborhood.<|endoftext|>
Others,That is what I'm here for. If you ever need anything else don't hesitate to reach out and good luck. I know you are going to do great and be just fine.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,Have you tried reaching out to friends or other family members to help take some of the load off? It may help to even get an afternoon for yourself.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Yes this would also make me feel isolated as well.<|endoftext|>
Information,I have heard of some people receiving assistance from their community by supplying food and basic needs. This may be worth looking into.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yes I am sure it may help relieve some of the stress your are feeling.<|endoftext|>
Question,What type of activities do you enjoy when you do have time alone?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Me too! I try to read whenever I can. It can take you out of the moment of the daily grind. I have a long list of books to get to.<|endoftext|>

Question,Is it possible for your partner to help with some of the load?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I feel you. My kids have been at home during this pandemic because the schools are shut down and I cannot imagine what the parents working full time and dealing with this are going through.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"As a mom, I struggle with that too, trying to get everything done, while being present. But i do find that with kids, the more simple the better. They just want us and out time. things do not have to be complex, even small things reading a bedtime story, or actually sitting down together for dinner helps.<|endoftext|>"

Question,How can I be of support to you?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,The virus is keeping me isolated. Looking to chat. I will like to chat. I can relate to that.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So your x is wanting more, mine is doing so to control me.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance",I can understand the emotion part as mine had lawyer who that encouraged her to seek more. I am not wanting to be with anyone because my x is jealous and wants me alone. I desire romance but feel that supporting two wives is too much.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Long walks alone sucks. I want to so much hold a hand walking, but I know she will try to stop any involvement.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I realize the desire to be alone, but find a female friend that wants to spend time together to keep you from feeling like you are going it alone.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others,Affirmation and Reassurance",Make a friendd 1st then the romance may come. There are a lot of lonely women who desire friendship as well. I am going on 5 years. I want a friend I can chat with over coffee. take it slow but find a friend. Just be yourself and let her be herself.<|endoftext|>

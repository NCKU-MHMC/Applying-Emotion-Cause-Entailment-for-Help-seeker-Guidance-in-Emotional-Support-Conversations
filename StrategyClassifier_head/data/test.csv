Question,Yes it is nice. Are you doing anything festive today?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","I understand that times are rough lately. Sounds like there is some time to figure it out, take full advantage of all the time you can. I hope it works out and a new position becomes available, I know your story is shared by many right now. What a crazy time we are in. yes it does, on top it says inputing.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question","what are cv's? I see, I am getting by by dping a billion a day lol. but there is other income, im not sure it would support me otherwise. Are there other lines of work you could look into?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"well the title sounds legit, lol, but yes i see and understand. Did you do the trainging in the warehouse for the research job?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure","oh i see. If this odd job tasks site exists maybe there a more related oppurtunites to get into that pay more. Or really, the green field is a good one to get into right now I think like solar companies and such. They are going to become more prevalent soon.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I make a good case right so you might think I was but no, I am not I only wish to be. I wish to be much more than I am but ya know I work with what I can find to do. Id savd the world every day if zi could knowing my efforts were toowrads a good cause. I always tell my other half, they might just take a chance and hire out of their skill zone if you have drive and interest in the field.<|endoftext|>"

Others,ok nice chat you too. good luck.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So it sounds like you've been struggling with finding a new job. It's never easy looking for a new job during these times. Why do you think you're having trouble?<|endoftext|>
Information,It sounds like you're motivated and dealing with a lot. Is there a specific job that you had in mind or are you applying to different kinds of jobs?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home. Have you talked with someone locally about jobs that would allow you to stay close to home?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It's great that you're staying productive and improving yourself. If your desire to improve yourself is as strong as your desire to find a new job I'm confident you will.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Don't let your past define you, let your present choices pave a new path into the future.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I'm confident you will. What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Thanks for sharing with me. Take care now.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hey what's going on?<|endoftext|>
Question,what are you mad about?<|endoftext|>
Question,what's going on at work that's so frustrating?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","wow, that's super frustrating! I would be pretty upset too. How did you find out?<|endoftext|>"
Question,wow... did anyone else hear?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I would be furious too. It puts you in a very strange spot. If you say something, you look bad, and if you don't you feel bad.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I absolutely understand. You know. the end of the year is coming up and it's probably not the best time to leave a job without having anything lined up.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,that's good! I think budgets are going to be tight in many industries and you need to make sure you are okay financially and have insurance and unfortuantely both of those are tied to employers.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That's a good point. I suggest continuing to look and see what you can find. There will be people hiring.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think that's a good call, you should definitely get out of there though, but make sure you have good enough coverage.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don't want to change.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can't change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It's very hard to lose friends to addictions. It's epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don't get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol. My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can't get stuck in them.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. Maybe you can write that on your list -- perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends. I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years, it isn't easy, but it's part of maturing in life.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I've learned the hard way, if a person doesn't want to change, I'm just beating my head against a wall. I can pray, then leave the rest to God. It seems like a lesson I learn over and over again! Hahah.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hello how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Others,"I am doing good, is there anything you would like to talk about?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am so sorry. I understand it must be hard to deal with I myself have a daughter. Did you press charges?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Information","That must be awful for her as well as you, I feel that sometimes the victims are left in the shadows when it comes to sexual assault. How is your daughter doing now?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","That's true alot of people dont come forward with sexual assault due to being not believed. She was very brave, and is a role model for others!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes friends are very helpful, Im glad she had that.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Therapy can be a great thing especially if you find that one therapist you feel comfortable with. It always helps to talk about things.<|endoftext|>
Others,"No problem, have a great day!<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"I recommend  searching online about meditation , also one of thing that helped the most for me was exercise and eating healthy.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I remember many times i thought the same way as you but i didnt give up and kept trying. As long as you dont give up you will make progress. It will take time and patience.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"OF course , for example i watched youtube videos of someone called theanxietyguy and i made tremendous progress with him. Also i drink teas to calm my nerves .<|endoftext|>"

Information,"I drink a lot of chamomile tea with honey which has a great flavor good to calm done, i drink mint tea very refreshing and tilo tea which helps me sleep.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Yes of course. If you worried about some kind of sickness i would recommend you go to the doctor get yourself a full checkup  it will help calm you mind down and reassure you that you are healthy.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","Yes, once in while i get nervous about but i try to keep positive and take the right precautions and wear my mask, clea my hands and stay my distance. you shouldnt have a issues . Do you workout?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,What really worked for me was cycling. Since its a great cardio workout and its fun. You would enjoy it. Maybe you can get a friend and try it out.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Thanks for sharing that with me. I'm so sorry you've been feeling like that. Breakups are so hard and can cause so much grief.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know those feelings of sadness can feel like they will never end- I have felt that way too before.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"But they do pass eventually and become easier to manage- with time and care. Do you have anyone in your life, a friend or family member who you can lean on when you're feeling so sad?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It sounds like it's hard to have your best friend not be as supportive as you want during this hard time. What has been helping you to pass the time these days- do you have any activities or hobbies that you like to do to relax, have fun, or take your mind of things?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,That's a great idea. I love taking walks and bike rides outside when I feel down. I also have a little dog and she helps me whenever I'm feeling lonely- dogs are great at providing comfort and unconditional love.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"My dog has also helped me meet other people and make friends- sometimes I'll walk my dog with others or go on bike rides with friends. If there is a dog park or local park nearby, maybe you can go and talk to other people there- talking about your dogs is a great icebreaker!<|endoftext|>"
Information,I'm glad to hear that! I hope you have a great time there! Research has also shown that spending time outside everyday is really good for our mental health.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Restatement or Paraphrasing","If you are still interested in getting a bike, I'd say go for it too! Biking is a great stress relief and form of exercise that often makes me feel better. I am so glad to hear that and am so happy you are talking to me is making you feel better.<|endoftext|>"
Information,Those are both great ideas! Yoga in the park sounds awesome. Yoga is another great stress reliever and form of exercise that is often free or very inexpensive.<|endoftext|>
Question,I am very glad to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today? I am here to listen.<|endoftext|>
Information,Reading and journaling are also great tools to use. Even when you are feeling down it can be helpful to write down your feelings as a form of release.<|endoftext|>
Others,That sounds like a great plan. Good luck and I hope you continue to feel better.<|endoftext|>
Others,You're very welcome.<|endoftext|>

Question,"Good, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Others,You can tell me what's bothering you.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Totally understand your worries.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there a reason for your fear?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"it's important right now to take one step at a time, you should always prepare and find a backup plan in case it happens, but at the same time not worry too much because it won't help.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others",You should look around and see if anyone hiring. I would say go for part time jobs too in case there is nothing available in your industry.<|endoftext|>
Information,"You can try gig worker, being on Mturk can bring some decent money if you're diligent.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel that you are trapped and yet you are not coping properly?<|endoftext|>
Information,I suggest that you talk to a counsellor.  There should be free services available at your university.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Well, perhaps they can at least alleviate your anxiety somewhat. Or maybe even get you a sick note to give you a little extra  time to complete your assignment.s.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"No, as long as you have a doctor's letter explaining why.<|endoftext|>"
Others,There is more than one way to be sick. You sound as though you are suffering from depression and stress.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you have any friends or family that you can discuss this with?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is she sympathetic to what you are feelign?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Well that is a good start. Maybe you could make a list of things you want to discuss with your counsellor too.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Try not to worry - I hope that things go well with you.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions",All the best to you in your future and thank you for talking! You have to press quit first cos I can't :).<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,There are people out there who can help. Would you consider anti anxiety medication?<|endoftext|>

Others,I wish you all of the best with it! Thank you for talking to me.<|endoftext|>
Others,Goodnight :).<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi! How are you this evening?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Sorry to hear that. How long have you been in a slump?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can understand that. It's been hard on a lot of people. Sometimes marriages need a bit of help during tough times, have you considered a counselor?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"My husband and I have gone a few times and it really helped having an objective person give us a few tips. We learned a lot even in just a few short months. We set goals, achieved them and then years passed and went again. That's too bad that he won't go again. I would still go for yourself. I have gone by myself because I needed extra help.  And it's hard to deal with someone who doesn't want to grow and change.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","I had an auto immune disorder too, actually, the counseling helped that a lot. Emotions have a way of wreaking havoc on our bodies. And it sounds like life has been stressful for you lately. Having a physical problem is really hard to deal with in addition to problems in marriage. Do you have any goals set?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","It sounds like you have a full plate with the little one. I know a lot of people are fearful now, but rest assured, children are really resilient to disease. The CDC has not even one record of a healthy child dying. Can you still go to the park and let them run and play? I think it's healthier to be around people then to isolate. That's my personal observation. It's really taking a toll on all of us emotionally to be distant. little ones . . .<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","One thing that comes to mind about your marriage is how I continued to work on myself, and surprisingly, some of the changes I made in myself helped my husband change. For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time.  So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain. I would encourage you to write out some goals and things you want to change about yourself, ideas for you and your children to do. And fight the blues as hard as you can. I find that if I have a list of things I need to do, I can follow that even when I don't feel like it, and sometimes I get out of the slump.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","It sounds like you do know good things to do, and that sometimes you need that encouragement and and support. Do you have friends maybe to check in with? Just to chat. I have been doing that myself. Just phoning people to connect. It has helped so much. Just to say hi and share my life. Life has a way of handing us curveballs. It upsets us then we don't know what to do, we fall down and get in a slump. And I find that writing lists, making goals, calling friends, doing things differently, brainstorming solutions can help me get back on track.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It is NOT weird. I'm like a granma to you! hahaha I'm almost 60. We need people in our lives, older, younger, all ages. We all learn from each other. Perhaps call and aunt and check in with them. Sometimes it makes us feel better to reach out and encourage others.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"As for your son and homeschooling, I'm sure you are challenged but think of this as a great opportunity. Perhaps teach him to cook? Make games up that are learning games about how to care for a home, perhaps repair things, all kinds of ideas. Perhaps have him test you on things.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I'm glad I could encourage you. You sound very intelligent and caring. Marriage is hard work, so is motherhood, but it can be rewarding and fulfilling. Sometimes we lose track of that and we need ideas to perk us up again and help us remember our goals.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you are feeling lonely and bereft? I am sorry to hear that. Can you give me more information?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Ah, so you were overseas and were conducting the relationship long distance?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Do you feel that is unfair of her to have done this whilst you were away serving your country?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question","But she should have understood that you were doing your duty whilst also providing for the pair of you. Do you think it is possible that she has been unfaithful, or is it something else?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Ah I see. How committed did you feel to her?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I know, as a woman myself. that it is quite difficult when you are seeing someone but have no idea what their intentions are.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Have you considered getting some sort of counselling, either just you or as a couple?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am hearing you say that you still have feelings for her but you are not sure whether to totally break away or not, given that she has.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I can't tell you what to do but I think it might be best to go with your gut instinct.<|endoftext|>
Others,It has to be your decision but I think you will know if you've made the right one.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope that I have been able to give you some good advice and that you feel a little clearer about things now.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Thank you for that .. I am glad to have been on assistance. I wish you all the very best in your future, wherever it takes you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you and best wishes!<|endoftext|>
Others,I have to stay here but feel free to show yourself out :).<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I know sometime it's really frustrating. I am pretty sure you will definitely able to find one.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,May I know your requirements for the place other than closer to work? would you like to share the accommodation?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I am really sorry to know about that. Your partner should understand your situation.<|endoftext|>
Others,You should search online or ask your friends or family for help if you they live nearby.<|endoftext|>
Others,It is really hard to find a good place to live. Time and money are sometime the big constraints but we should keep trying.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It is always hard to find true friends. You must be a strong person and I know you can achieve anything.<|endoftext|>
Others,Believe in yourself and don't give up. Definitely some solution will be around.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am really sorry to hear about that. I also got laid off and was worried, then I start searching online work. Found it and doing it now. Hope it will work for you too.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,At this tough time we need to stay motivated and keep trying.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I really like talking to you, hope it will help you in staying positive.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,There is no harm in taking doctors advice. Sorry to here about that. you can try online counselling. there are so many website offering free counselling sessions. you can search on google.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I would suggest follow your routine, stay motivated and keep looking to for the new place. Sometime sitting with the partner and having conversation with the person might help.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Have you ever tried to quit this habit or had counselling before? That might be the reason.  It is not impossible to quit it. you just need bit guidance.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Others",I can understand is is not that easy. Time is really tough right now. We as human being nothing is impossible for us to do. Problem like  drugs can be quitted if we stay strong and determined.  It is hard to say that drugs can not make us normal. I can understand your situation. You think that its normal for you but other has different outlook. I think same thing is happening between you and your partner.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It was nice talking to you. Take care and stay positive.<|endoftext|>
Others,Bye.<|endoftext|>
Others,Hey! How are you?<|endoftext|>
Question,What are these thoughts? :).<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Not constantly. because then you won't have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yeah, maybe.  But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,yes that's the spirit! And with that mind set good things will always come to you!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, as long as you keep focused and not divert into any other thoughts :).<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I do it once a week and it really helps. I used to do it more often when I felt I couldn't do anything right, so always do it according to the situation.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Yes. If you want to.<|endoftext|>
Others,"But im here for you but if we are done lets wrap it up :) yes, byee.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"he might not, maybe if you just give him time, you might feel different about him aswell. Dont you think?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","okay, is there anything you can do to take your mind off things? or speak to anyone about it?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"okay, have you ever tried meditation?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"okay, I understand.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Why don't you want nobody to find out, if I might ask?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"okay, isn't it best to do what you think is right though?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","okay fair enough. Why do you still want him even though, he broke up with you if you don't mind me asking?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"it might be hard, but isn't it better to see how things go without him. It's not good to be a relationship if someone isn't 100 percent dont you agree?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"it might feel like that now, but in time I am sure it will change.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"okay, in my opinion I believe its best to be strong and try and focus on yourself and live a good life without him for now, until he changes his mind then maybe you re-asses the situation.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information","if you can't help him, its best you try and focus on yourself. no worries, I am here for you. what are you plans for today?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think it is better, yes because then we can we see a better future :).<|endoftext|>"

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","I am sorry you feel ignored sometimes people choose to ignore issues rather than confront them and try to come to some sort of solution, i would try not to take it to personnel as you seem like a very friendly person.

Question,Are you asking how to end the chat?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I think you need to spend some time doing something you enjoy to try to take your mind off of it, maybe go to a movie or for a nice walk.

Providing Suggestions,(can you press quit and take the survey? I can't do it at my end. Thanks for talking!).<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,*beams* ... you just need to press quit.<|endoftext|>
Question,What's been going on lately?  Is something in particular there stressing you out?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh wow, that wounds really rough.  So you haven't been able to work in the same way since Corona?  Do you have any ideas of things you could do to make ends meet?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oh, I see.  That does sound really rough.  I would be feeling the exact same way you are in that situation and I'm sorry you're going through that.  I know this sounds cliche, but I do believe that things will work out.  I once heard, ""It'll always work out in the end.  If it hasn't worked out, it's not the end."".<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I know there were some grants and loans and things specifically set aside for small businesses for the pandemic.  You might want to look into local resources and see if some are available to help you just to make ends meet for the time being?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"There's so much information and disinformation out there, it can be really hard to discern help.  There's one website: sba.gov that has several different options for pandemic relief for small businesses.  I don't know what are you're in but there are some local resources available from my local government websites too, you might want to check that out too!<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Excellent, I hope you're able to find some relief through this difficult time!  I have a friend who looked into it and was able to find a small grant to help him out!<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I have heard that another one is coming, and this one should be better than the last one.  It's all dependent on income, so anyone that makes less than 80k a year should be getting the full amount according to what I've heard.  I agree, they did help!  Would that ease your burden a little bit if the next one comes soon?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Hang in there, I'm sure help is on the way and your positive attitude will help carry you until then, you seem like a really strong person.  For me, I try taking really deep breaths and even meditating if it gets really bad.  Have you ever tried anything like that?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You're not failing as long as you're still trying and not giving up.  All we can do sometimes is pick ourselves back up and keep plugging along.  There are a few apps available that have calming music, stories to listen to,  or even breath exercises to try.  They are all over the app stores.  It definitely helps me!  Meditation has been proven to help a lot of people in stressful situations.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Of course, so happy to be of help!  Hopefully we can talk again soon and catch up on how you've been doing.  It helps me a lot to know I'm helping others too, any kind of service always feels nice.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you, you too!<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I'm sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I'm sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Remember that age is only a number and love will no no number, we are hear to listen and support you so if you ever need to talk just know we are a mouse click away.<|endoftext|>"

Others,I'm OK as well.<|endoftext|>
Question,How do you feel when that happens?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",That can be really frustrating. What do you do when it happens?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",It's good that you're seeking help from your supervisor. Is your coworker open to suggestions and feedback?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you can seek help from other coworkers as well. They may be able to provide you with support with this situation.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I've been in a situation similar to this and I found that talking to some of my friends outside of work has helped me to express some of my frustration and gain perspective.<|endoftext|>
Question,It seems like you have found a way to manage it during work. Why do you think that she is trying to do your work?<|endoftext|>
Others,It was nice talking to you too. I hope that it was a helpful conversation.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","hmm I don't know....I didn't get one.   I gather you are in the US? CAn you tell me more about your art gear project? It sounds like you are frustrated that the stiimulus check program has not helped you get your art project off the ground, am I right? Are you still with me?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Information,Providing Suggestions","I see.   Have you looked into bartering?   Someone who has such a lense may be willing to barter it for something you have, or some service you could offer them. Locally here we have some bartering groups on facebook, maybe there is something similar in your area? The other thing you could try is crowdfunding, for example kickstarter, in which you offer some photograply (portrait if you do such?) in exchange for a donation from someone locally.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","I remember a similar frustration when I needed tools I could not afford to make jewelry.   It held me up! Are there any second hand stores near you that might have used lenses? it sounds like it is holding you up from doing your photography, that must be frustrating.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"oh good, Ebay is a great idea.  I hope eventually you will find one you can afford, with some patience!<|endoftext|>"
Question,I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling about that?<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"I understand, I have faced similar circumstances. What can you do to prepare for a change one way or another?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Could you look at jobs you think you would like even more?<|endoftext|>
Information,Perhaps it is a chance to gain new experiences or find an even better company!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Sometimes for me I have to change how I look at the situation.<|endoftext|>
Others,"When I think something is all bad, I have to look for the positive. I look at it as maybe you will find a great company that values it's employee's but you won't know unless you try.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,That seems like a hard situation. It must be difficult.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello how are you?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign.it as well.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","it's okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them. Is there anything else bothering you at work?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"as long as you believe in yourself to be honest, don't worry about what other people think. Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Yes, i understand what you are saying. It's really hard to move on from bad experiences, staying positive is important in these situations.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,There's no need to thank me! i hope I could make you feel better.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes, you too! have an amazing rest of your day!<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Others",I'm sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Did you guys break up recently?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong.  You shouldn't blame yourself.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I've been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me.  We had some space, and then were able to become friends again.  And you know what?  We ended up getting back together and getting married.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Don't give up, you never know what the future holds. I don't know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work.  I don't think you should blame yourself.<|endoftext|>"

Question,What did she say when you broke up?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Yikes!  I'm sure that didn't feel very good.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Information","Have you tried talking to her since? Oftentimes people have confused feelings and after some time to reflect, things might change.<|endoftext|>"
Information,She may need some space to figure things out.  I know it's going to be tough but I believe you can get past this.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear you are frustrated! I'm gonna do my best to understand and talk through your issue. :).Your friend is being a pain on face book in what way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It sounds like he didn't use to blast his opinion in the past or include you in arguments, is that true?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Oh I see! I get where you are coming from. I have a few friends that no matter how long you discuss, they won't let the conversation end unless ""they are right."" It seems like your friend doesn't like it when he is wrong?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Gotcha so not only are you frustrated with what he is doing, but you are also worried about his reputation! First of all, can I ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Okay I see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost ""hiding"" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"A suggestion I would make would be to hangout with him in person, and bring up the issues that you and your friends have been seeing. But it's important to not make him feel overwhelmed. Almost like he is being ""ganged up on."".<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","I can tell that you care about this person as a friend, but you are worried that the way he thinks and talks may ruin that in a way. Make sure to let him know these concerns! It will show him that you guys truly are doing it out of love. And yes I have actually had a very similar experience! Let me explain.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"One of my best friend's and roommate, had a very hard time separating friendship and roommate issues. It caused a lot of issues in the relationships with our friends. She had a tendency to discuss issues over text and didn't like doing it in person. But we realized, the problem with that is that you can't tell the emotion behind messages on a screen. But once we talked in person, our issues were solved because we could hear the intended emotions behind what we were saying.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes exactly. It sounds like he might have other reasonings behind his actions. And you guys talking to him as friends in person, would show him that you care and that he is in a safe environment. He doesn't need to be so extreme.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yes of course! I wish you the best in overcoming this hard time with your friend. I believe that you guys will be able to talk through it since it's a newer issue. :).<|endoftext|>
Others,Of course! Have a good rest of your day.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, glad to meet you virtually. How are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am good.  How may I help you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I completely get that.  I am thinking that most people are feeling isolated therefore communication with others are feeling even more challenging thank usual.  Playing games can certainly help.  What type of games do you play?  Perhaps there are people that share the same interests.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Multi player games help I would assume.  Do you play with people you actually know sometimes?  I am sure that you make a great friend so we can explore areas of meeting new people,  I can tell you that I am not having the easiest time keeping up with friends and I am certainly not meeting new people in person very often myself.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Okay so perhaps play with people as opposed to solo.   Do you think it would be worth a try?<|endoftext|>
Question,You are quite welcome.  Perhaps I can play as well.  Is it easy to catch on or are the games you play difficult?<|endoftext|>
Question,Got it! Do you play sports or any other activities where you encounter people?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I'm doing really well, thanks.  What brings you here today?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question",I can appreciate that.  Thinking about lost loves makes me sad too! What about this particular relationship makes you feel sad?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","Oh...I see, you think s/he's the ""one who got away?"". Why did you break up?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure",Wow...that does sound painful. I know how hard it is to let go of a guy you really loved.  I've had to break up with a few of them over the years!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"In the long run, I feel that those break-ups were absolutely necessary.  I'm in a really good place now.  And they are too.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I eventually learned to think of it like this: every man I loved taught me something important about myself.  ANd I taught them things about themselves.  ANd it doesn't happen overnight.  But eventually, you will probably be able to see how you grew as a result of the breakup. Maybe the things you will learn can help you be ready for Mr Right!<|endoftext|>"
Others,That's a really good way of looking at it.<|endoftext|>
Others,Oohh.... I think it really depended on how long I was with them.  ANd why I decided to end it.  The longer relationships Maybe a few weeks to a few months before I was ready to move on and try again.  BUt Only a fraction of that was crying with Ben & Jerry's!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"For me it just happened that one day, I thought about Gary and I didn't really feel that sad anymore.  I just thought...wow, we had some good times. B&J's and a few good rom-coms ought to put you in a better mood!  Lol.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions","It really sounds like you are making progress! Just remember the old saying ""time heals all wounds."".<|endoftext|>"
Others,It's my pleasure!  I hope you keep feeling stronger!<|endoftext|>
Others,"You know, I believe you!<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question","hello. you feel sad, why?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,your health is fine and you have place to live but you are still sad.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,You are welcome. Sometimes you will pay as little as 0-$20 a session. I've found this to be helpful in my life on multiple occasions.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"You have to find what is available. Avoid big buildings full of psychologists, usually the more independent practices are reasonable and provide better service IMO.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Probably someone to talk to, so just a counselor or therapist fits the bill. I am not a doctor so don't take anything I say as medical advice btw.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I found a lot of chat boards and information from a google search. You are not alone and it is OK to feel and to be going through this.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds really hard. Depression is tough to manage.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I can feel that you have a lot of pent up frustration with this, especially after trying so hard.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Lot of research shows that feelings of anger can morph into depression, that is not uncommon.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I can tell that this has been very hard for you, especially since it has gone on so long.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Why do you think you were angry?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","Ouch, that sounds really hurtful, but I know you are doing your best now. My parents divorced when I was young, but now I understand it has given me the opportunity to grow stronger as an adult.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Do you participate in any peer support groups? Those can really help let that emotion release?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Of course, there's lots of information available online for local meetings. Perhaps trying a group like ACA could really connect you with your inner child.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Especially when the sun starts going down sooner, it can seem like we have less time, and as if things are closing in upon us.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","There are a few strategies you could use to combat that.  Personally, I try to soak in as much sunlight as possible before it goes down.  Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D. As far as the intrusive and repetitive nature of the thoughts, have you ever consulted with a therapist or other mental health professional?  Obsessive thoughts are sometimes a sign of anxiety.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",That's an understandable fear. I challenge you to think about it as not too different from this chat here;  An opportunity to get some objective advice and perspective.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, BetterHelp is one of those I believe. TalkSpace is another one.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It may be helpful!  As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too.  So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else. The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself:  When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you ""need"" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room.  Change the situation up, get some tea, sparkling water, whatever you want, but change what your body is literally doing.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","You sound optimistic and like you're open to trying new things to help, I think you're going to start feeling better soon. LOL my friend calls that ""vacation bed!"" and sleeps on the couch over the weekend like it's a treat :-D.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Things may take some time, but every time you take action to get better, it will help.  You are very welcome! I hope you have a wonderful evening :-).<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hello, how can I help you today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Is there anything that's specifically causing the stress? Probably some big changes?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you're facing some potential instability which can definitely increase anxiety. What strategies have you been trying so far?<|endoftext|>
Others,"For the short term, have you tried looking in to meditation or breathing exercises? For a longer approach, have you thought about gaining some new skills for the job market?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Sounds like reading might be a good way to get your mind out of the anxiety loop, does that sound right?<|endoftext|>"
Others,That's great! Maybe you can take that a step further and read some material on mindfulness.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So, you don't feel like you have a secure spot right now, is that right?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can you tell me what your job is?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Ok, have there been any talks about layoffs? Or any concerns about your performance?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So you're nervous about things that might happen in the future, but there's no talks about anything concrete?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Nice to meet you, Marie. How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I see. That sounds like a difficult situation. Could you tell me a bit more about your job?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"After you get home, you focus on your boyfriend when he comes home from work. Do I understand correctly?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Ok. So you are having some conflict with your boyfriend?<|endoftext|>
Question,Are the issues about money? Work? Many different things?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Ok. So you would like to have more information about his schedule and when you will be together with him. Is that correct?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Ok. He is socializing with his co-workers and you would prefer that he come home and spend time with you. Is that right?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ok. Socializing with co-workers is sometimes part of the job. Of course, your relationship with him is much more important, or it should be to him. What does he say when you talk to him about this?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Ok. By the way, do you have friends that you could socialize with? I understand that you want to spend time with him, but what other people do you have in your life?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Ok. Do you enjoy chatting with people online? You seem to chat well with me, so I think that you could connect with others virtually.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hobbies are a good way to connect with people. What do you like to do?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ok. My suggestions is that you find a friend or two to connect with virtually or physically. Perhaps joining a club, a gym or a class would help. This is one way for you to gain control of the situation.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Passive entertainment is not bad, but it does not help you make friends. Zumba and other activities are great for health and can help you meet people. Is there a place in your neighborhood?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You might want to see a medical doctor about that. There are probably treatments that would help you adjust to social settings.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Sometimes there are free clinics, and perhaps a university has programs so that their students can learn to help patients.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"True, but it is important to take steps toward changing your situation.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I hope that this chat has helped you.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I understand. Life is about change. The past can loom large and we need to understand how it affects our perspective on life.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Ok. You are not them. You are a different person. You can make your own choices.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is a good first step. Good for you!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Now it is time for more steps.<|endoftext|>
Question,That is an odd request. Why do you think he wanted that?<|endoftext|>
Information,It sounds like you have unresolved conflict with your father.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Ok. Well, I've enjoyed chatting with you. I need to go now.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I feel like dying all the time. It's very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you are saying that you can't live regularly and people don't understand that your mind isn't working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question","That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn't want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"That makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things, which is a good thing, but is there anything that you try to do that isn't avoidance? Something that approaches something?<|endoftext|>"
Question,How do you feel about therapy?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That is unfortunate, but I understand. We haven't finished, the task, however, but I hope you feel better.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I think we just need 3 more responses each, let's say.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Okay, so can you tell me how frequently you sleep?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That sounds awful. I'm sorry. Have you tried researching or practicing any sleep hygiene?<|endoftext|>
Information,"Smoking and drinking alcohol can cause sleep problems before bed. Do you do those things? What troubles your rest, you think?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"hello, how are you? How is your day today?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Providing Suggestions",Oh! don't feel like this try to feel relaxe. Try to make yourself confidence and relax.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Try to give more time to your studies.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,Online work can be very lucrative. I have been doing it for years personally. It is nice to be your own boss and choose your own hours.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It is true that stability is important. Do I hear you say that you are frightened of the insecurity of working from home?<|endoftext|>
Question,Ah .. I am in the UK so we have socialised medicine :). Would you feel more comfortable if you lived in a country like that?<|endoftext|>
Others,Goodness .. I do not have to pay anything. Also our prescriptions are fixed at about ten pounds each. I think maybe your job dilemma would be easier if you moved to a different country :D.<|endoftext|>
Others,You might be able to make that much from home though. And what's life if you don't take the odd risk?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question,Others",Yes I am :). Is there anything else that you'd like to talk about ? I hope I have been able to be of some help to you :).<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. What's been happening?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's not very fair. You deserve to feel valued at your workplace and it sounds like you don't feel that way.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,You haven't done anything wrong. I have felt that way at work before too. I went to therapy to deal with my difficult work situation.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You could bring it up with your boss. That would be a very brave thing to do.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Usually, bosses are required to keep those sorts of things confidential. You could request to speak to someone in Humane Resources, who is trained to help workers.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"You could speak to your coworkers and let them know that you would like a friendlier, more open work environment. Do you think that might help?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That might be a good place to start when it comes to approaching them. Let them know your side of the situation and maybe they will understand.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I think buying coffee and doughnuts sounds like a wonderful idea. It seems like you are really willing to help create a healthier work environment.<|endoftext|>

Others,Goodnight to you as well!<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there a general problem that you would like to talk about? I am more than happy to listen.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I am sorry to hear that but try not to panic, just failing one class is not the end of the world. How do you feel about retaking it?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Ah so you feel that this is going to be severely disruptive to your plans for this winter break?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Is it possible for you to get any sort of private tutoring which might help you?<|endoftext|>
Others,Ah .. in that case is it possible to talk to your doctor? They might be able to get a special allowance for you given your personal circumstances.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think that it would be a really good idea if you talked to them about it. They will probably be a lot more understanding than you might think.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"If they love you, and I am sure that your family do, then they will accept what has happened without criticism.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's even a better reason for you to just forget about her, with her cheating on you like that, you know she's not the type for you.  You're so much better than her.  So just focus on yourself.  If you need some help emotionally, find yourself a counselor to talk to.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Just try to focus on your hobbies, and hang out with your close friends.  Keep yourself occupied on other things so you wouldn't have to think about her.  Just think that you're lucky that it ended now, and it would've been worse if you found out about the cheating even later.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Awww maybe try to share you feelings with your family then.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I see.  Over time you'll definitely be able to get over it.  There are so many other women out there that are better than her.

Providing Suggestions,Have you tried talking to him about his drinking? Is he otherwise a pretty good friend when he's sober?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I'm a early 30s woman from Michigan, and I actually used to have a problem with my drinking as well. People kind of pushed the problem aside though because drinking is so socially acceptable. But maybe if you talk to him right after it's happened and offer to be a sober friend with him, it could help.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","Yeah, I get that, that's why it was so hard for me to quit. I hit it pretty hard for 13 years before I finally got sober! It's a tough thing to do when everyone else is drinking. It's just getting to that realization that you don't have the same relationship as alcohol as everyone else. Hopefully if you have a chat with him he can get to that point. I'm just staying at home with my kid and homeschooling her right now since the schools are closed.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Ours as well, I just decided to do homeschooling at the beginning of the year so that I wouldn't have to deal with all the back and forth of the districts.

Providing Suggestions,"Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner..<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications. I don't think it would be pushing if you haven't had that conversation in almost a year.<|endoftext|>"

Others,"Oh I am so sorry! That is a really unpleasant thing to do to someone, especially at this time of year.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is there anyone close to you that you can talk to about this? Friends?<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,"It really is not is it! I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is  really sore point.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Have you felt like this for a while or has it only been a recent change in your feelings and motivation?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That must be a real challenge and if it is a recent change it is natural to feel concerned about this.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I do not always feel positive and motivated myself and have spoken to a professional in the past which helped me understand why this is, for me it was linked to a lack of sleep.<|endoftext|>"
Information,People's moods can be regulated by many things. I know for example that sleep and diet can play a big part in some cases.<|endoftext|>

"Others,Question",Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Self-disclosure","Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more.Since that time, he denies everything.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hmm... So have you two live together?  How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.<|endoftext|>
Question,"But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It seems like you are missing someone. Hope I get it correct.<|endoftext|>
Question,May I know where the person is right now whom you are missing so much?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,means far away from you. It must be hard for you to stay apart from him.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","That's great! I can feel you really have a great family support. When I miss someone, I tried to call that person or do video call and spend time virtually. It makes me feel like that person is not far from me. I really feel connected. You should do that often.<|endoftext|>"
Others,May I know do you have any issues with each other?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,oh Sorry to hear about that. Are you still having good bon? If you want to stay connected with someone it is really important to have communication with each other.<|endoftext|>
Information,That's great if you want to move forward and forget about it. You should engage yourself in the activities which you like. It will help you a lot coming out from this situation.<|endoftext|>
Others,Best wishes for you! Please let me know if you need any other help.<|endoftext|>
Others,ok! Have a wonderful day!<|endoftext|>
Others,I think you should submit the test now.<|endoftext|>
Others,I don't have the option to do  that as a Peer supporter.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It at right bottom below where we are typing chat.<|endoftext|>
Others,yes click on that. You can only do that. I have only quit option.<|endoftext|>

Information,"No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won't help.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think that could be a good idea if it's not too far out of your way.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",You could also tell a teacher what is happening. They will help you out. I bet you are handsome! Don't let it get to you.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Working out will help a lot! When I was feeling down on myself I decided to go to the gym three times a week. It was a great confidence boost.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds like a fantastic idea.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",Not to warm here. Where do you live.<|endoftext|>
Question,That is a cold state. How can I help you today?<|endoftext|>
Others,That is understandable. Was it because of the virus.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,PA got hit hard with the virus.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you can find out which classes your child struggles with and contact the teacher(s) or school to set up a conference? I know some schools even have peer tutors they say help pair students with!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,My children are five and eight. My eight year old spent about ten hours doing digital learning the other day when in-perosn was closed. I was so frusterated. I let her pick a movie and snack when she was done to reward her for finishing.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",Have you looked into any edulational or learning games? There is nothing wrong with rewarding your child for doing good in school or getting thier work done! :).<|endoftext|>
Information,"I have done that with my kids. Technology is such a huge part of children's lives these days, they will play a videogame in a heart beat. I don't think they even realize they are learning sometimes!<|endoftext|>"
Information,check out the website adventure academy. They have things for all ages/grades!<|endoftext|>
Others,I'm glad I could help! You too!<|endoftext|>
Question,"okay, what is it?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think it is natural for a a parent to feel guilty when they are having thier child do something the child doesn't want to do. i think the benefits outweigh the negatives though. i think finding a way to make studying fun could be a win-win. you are a good parent for wanting the best for your child!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think there should be more parents out there that care about their children and their children's future like you do. keep up the good work!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hello! How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I understand, you feel like your losing everyone close to you and wondering about your own mortality now as well?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you told your aunts how much you love them? It may comfort you to know that you've shared exactly how you feel with them while they are here.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",I try to let everyone know I love them too just because we never know when we aren't going to be here anymore. I definitely understand where you are coming from. Have you tried looking at any YouTube videos about life and mortality?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I personally have found some comfort in hearing other people struggle with their own mortality or their beliefs in an after life or different things. Maybe that could be something you could try looking into.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",It sounds to me like you've felt alone in your struggles and you are not alone! Yes I have and I've heard from many others who have as well. That and there are some great books out there also!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm so happy I could be here for you! It's not fun to feel alone, if we can all lean on each other in times of need the world will be a better place.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I've personally enjoyed looking into all the different types of religions and spiritual beliefs from around the world. It's nice hearing about different beliefs on life and death.<|endoftext|>
Others,You are very welcome! Again I am happy to help and would love to chat any time you are feeling anxious about anything at all! I am always here for you!<|endoftext|>
Others,You are very welcome! I hope you have a great rest of your day and please don't hesitate to message if you want to chat again!<|endoftext|>
Others,Thank you I will! Take care!<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi there! How are you doing?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm good! It's a beautiful evening where I am. What's on your mind?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Oh wow! Well first of all, I want to say that I definitely empathize with you. My first job out of college was one of the most stressful times of my life. It does get better though. What is stressful about your job?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","Oh wow, that sounds really hard, and I can only imagine it is so difficult to be breaking into a new career entirely working from home. Even people I know who have been in their jobs a long time are struggling with remote work. It is hard if your company is not being flexible on deadlines during this time. Have you found any strategies that have helped a tiny bit?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I totally feel that! I think that has been a struggle for me during quarantine too - the ""quarantine fifteen!"" I have had to look for other forms of comfort to keep that at bay ... but I did bake cookies tonight :). I know I'm just an mturk rando, but the one thing I know that has helped almost everyone I know with career stress is having a mentor. Especially someone who is not at your company. Do you know anyone, even a friend of a friend, who could maybe be a sounding board for your career?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","Oh say no more! I totally get that just based on my own background as well. The only thing I could recommend is to cast a wide net when thinking about mentorship... maybe even a former professor in your field could recommend a former student who graduated a few years before you. Just a thought, but I know for myself, it's nice to have validation if the people I am working with are having unfair expectations. I hope that helped a bit, and if not, please let me know. We can keep chatting and dig into this a bit more if you'd like. What do you think?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I really enjoyed talking with you! Also, I just have to say, we are all having such a hard time with this pandemic. It's not just you - you aren't broken. You are doing your best as we alll are :).<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You are totally welcome! I've been where you are (minus the pandemic). You will make it, and you really will adjust to the stress and also find better jobs over time.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I hope so! Best of luck to you... straight outta Austin, TX :).<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,i am fine thanks for asking.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful.<|endoftext|>"
Question,are you taking a lot of courses?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,do you like doing school online better than in person?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Thats good the more time you have to devote the better!<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you feel it is more stressful online?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something. Don't be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You are welcome, best of luck with all your studies!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you!<|endoftext|>
Question,Ah I hear you - I think that there is a lot of that going around during this pandemic. Did you ever have a problem before?<|endoftext|>
Others,"It has been horrendous hasn't it? Have you been able to at least speak to your doctor, even if you could not see them in person?<|endoftext|>"
Question,It might be time to get some more help? Do you think it is bad enough that you might need inpatient treatment?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It sounds like you have had a really hard time the last eighteen months. As the lockdown is easing, are there any new pastimes you could get involved in that might distract you?<|endoftext|>"
Information,Poker night does sound like something that might involve a lot of alcohol though :(.<|endoftext|>
Others,LOL well I am glad to hear that at least. Splitting a twelve pack between six does not seem like a problem to me.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"That is possible as well and it is definitely worth talking to someone, I think, just in case.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","Well beer, to be perfectly honest :D. Anyway I hope that I can have been of assistance :).<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Just remember that it can get worse pretty quickly so it's best to talk to someone :) can you press quit first and take the survey? I can't at this end.<|endoftext|>
Question,I am okay but feeling a little down at the moment. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Is there anything specific getting you down? How are things in your work and your personal relationships? Oh I am sorry to hear that .. you are having a problem with a close friend?<|endoftext|>
Others,"No I did not, can you tell me about it?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you, I would like to be able to help you but do not know what the problem is right now.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Ah I see .. you feel as though you friend is dragging up things from the past which are no longer relevant to your friendship?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Oh I am sorry, I misunderstood. Can you tell me a little about the situation?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What is it that he wants you to apologise for?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",ah I see. I have had problems and sometime negative interactions about Covid with some friends too. I think it's a very difficult time for everybody; we are all feeling the strain and might be more irritable than previously. Can you see any way in which you can work around it and be friends again?<|endoftext|>
Others,I think that the tests are very necessary! Also social distancing and mask wearing at this time.<|endoftext|>
Others,I think that perhaps you do not need this toxic person in your life. After fifteen years without him do you really feel you need to stay r reconciled?<|endoftext|>
Others,In that case perhaps you can just agree to disagree on this topic? If you don't want to risk the friendship :). I hope I have been able to be of some help to you today and thank you for talking!<|endoftext|>
Others,And you too!<|endoftext|>
Others,bye! (only you can end the conversation .. I can not). Please can you quit or we will time out.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear things aren't going to well. What's the problem in a nutshell?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Breakups can be hard, I can understand your frustration. Five years is a long time to have a relationship and then end.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I'm sorry to hear that. That's hard to forgive and move on from that.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I find that when I have a very painful situation, I try to only thing about it for a certain amount of time. Then I make a list of things to do so I can be occupied to not think about it.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Getting over a breakup will take time? Have you ever heard of DABDA? Denial (I can't believe this happened!) Anger (we all know that) Bargaining (If only I had done that, or if only - trying to make it FEEL better by imagining other scenarios - doesn't really work) Depression - sadness, then Acceptance -- we go in and out of these emotions and sometimes it can make us feel crazy, but all of them are normal in varying degrees and we don't know when they will happen.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I would make a list of things you have always wanted to do and then just BRAINSTORM any idea, no idea is too out there -- learn to ice skate, learn to play the ukulele, sign up for dance lessons, join the gym, go to a singles group at church, visit the elderly, volunteer somewhere.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I also find it helpful not only to limit how much I dwell on my pain, but make sure I reach out to help someone else. I will tell you, that is the secret to happiness. Maybe help a neighbor with groceries or hanging lights. Old people (me) love help, bake something or call your aunt or uncle.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I agree, get healthy and try to help others. One thing about feelings is that if you change your mind, you can change your feelings, it might happen slowly, but if you put your mind off of it, it will help. Not saying NEVER feel the emotions, but feelings are the tail of the dog, not the dog itself, You do not have to be ruled by them. You don not have to FEEL like going for a walk to go for a walk.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"A healthy balance of self care, and other centered behavior and know this will take time. I just takes time.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand, but those are choices that really, long term, are not for your benefit. Her cheating was a reflection on HER bad character, not yours. You have to love yourself and try to fight this.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I'm a human. I live in KY, retired counselor! hhahaha I prayed for someone to encourage.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I'm from the city, so there isn't much to do on a farm in the middle of cold weather. I have been through a lot of breakups, so I know what works, and yes, I was cheated on, devastating. But you can overcome this. Make that list and do NOT let your feelings rule your life. You can recover and find someone worthy of your love and care.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"The WORST breakup came a year before I met my husband. in retrospect, it was the best thing, listen,you could have married this girl, count your blessings. cheating is just terribly destructive. And you are welcome. Take care of yourself. Write the list of goals and fun things to do, choose one every day.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Bye now! God bless!<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","That is understandable, public speaking is one of the most commonly cited fears for people. Is it for work or for school?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I actually majored in communication and have a great deal of experience with public speaking.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, the physical nervousness that can manifest is powerful.  I would highly recommend finding a quiet place to calm and focus your mind for at least five minutes before your presentation.  At least a minute's worth of breathing, and drink plenty of water.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Ah, yes, that is a hard one.  You are expected to be an expert.  But you can only prepare so much.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions,Providing Suggestions","""That is a really great question that I've never considered! Maybe XYZ?  I can check on that and get back to you with a sure answer though!"". There's no shame in being able to say that you understand why someone would ask the question(whatever it may be) but that you don't have a full or even partial answer right now. Because you're also going to get like, the hecklers and the people who want to look intelligent by asking asinine questions.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","Just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines.     Extra questions from students are wildcards and you can only handle them within the scope of the assignment. If someone's like WELL WHY AREN'T THERE PURPLE PANDAS THEN, JEFF?!  you're gonna have to just laugh lol.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I think you will do great.  You sound prepared, and a small amount of worry is an indication you desire to perform well.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I'm so glad to hear that!  You have an excellent attitude and work ethic, you got this!<|endoftext|>"
Others,You too!<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",Hello. How are you tonight?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don't know how to get through it.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I didn't like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things?<|endoftext|>
Question,Why did you stop playing insturments?<|endoftext|>
Others,I certainly hope you don't do that!<|endoftext|>
Others,I apologize that I wasn't able to make you feel any better.<|endoftext|>
Others,Have a wonderful evening!<|endoftext|>
Question,How are you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,What happened?<|endoftext|>
Information,I understand how you feel. Have you guys tried spending more time with each other? Maybe going out on dates?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Its never too late to put spice back into the relationship.<|endoftext|>
Information,Show her that your still love because by being spontaneous. Surprise her with gifts. Maybe take her on a random vacation somewhere. Have a deep conversation about how you are feeling and that you still love her and want her in your life. It might take a little bit but its better to try than not to try at all.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Start by talking about whats going on. Tell her how you think you guys should spend more time with her. Or that you dont want to lose her. Ask her if there is anything she might want to discuss. She maybe having issues shes afraid to talk about.<|endoftext|>
Information,I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground.<|endoftext|>
Information,Most likely a female therapist would be better. Nobody understands a woman more than a woman.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information","I suggest taking one step at a time. I wouldn't rush through things. I would suggest sitting down and talking through some things that are going on. Maybe taking some time away from work. Going out and spending time with each other as much as you can. If you guys think you may need a marriage counselor, I highly recommend it. I think it would be a great start.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Depending on the nature, I think you should let him know whats going on. He may already know.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know its really hard, but I think you guys with work things out. Have hope. Times are stressful, especially in this day and age.<|endoftext|>"
Information,goodbye.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi there, how are you feeling at the moment?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I am really sorry to hear that, is there anything specific causing this do you think?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel as though the virus has had a big impact on your life and is causing problems with your home situation?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried contacting charities who might be able to help you out financially?<|endoftext|>
Information,There is money to be  earned on the internet .. perhaps you could consider doing gig work?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I know how difficult it is - I have been on furlough too and am finding financial things very tricky.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,A lot of people are really suffering at the moment. It's been such a terrible year but I am hopeful that things will get better in the New Year.<|endoftext|>
Information,Have you thought of trying to see a therapist? There are some charities that offer sessions for free.<|endoftext|>
Information,They might be able to teach you breathing exercises or things like tht.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you normally have problems with anxiety even before the pandemic?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Yes I can imagine that a lot of people feel like that. Do you feel as though things are hopeless without a job?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you have a family to support?<|endoftext|>
Others,Do you feel that she feels less of you because of you being unemployed?<|endoftext|>
Others,I am really sorry for your situation and I really want things to be better for you in the New Year. All the best to you and yours for 2020!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Don't forget to quit and take the survey :).<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest.<|endoftext|>
Question,What happened that made you guys break up?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn't the right timing or she had other interests.<|endoftext|>
Information,"The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I've had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What is your age?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don't find a partner until their 40's or even 50's. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn't move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn't in love anymore?<|endoftext|>
Question,Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, I have had exes do that to me. Most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I would definitely confront her about it. I wouldn't get angry or fight about it. Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already. That is a really good indicator.<|endoftext|>
Information,"I would calmly ask her. She will most likely deny it. But, some ofher friends may already know about this. If she says she did, ask her if there was something you did wrongthat made her do it. Sometimes its not even the Cheatee. Sometimes they just do it for no good reason.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can you tell me more about the fight?<|endoftext|>
Question,Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple.  Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else ?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you talked since then?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don't be in a hurry to get into a new relationship , but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Breakups are not always the end, but they usually happen for a reason, and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,The sadness will eventually pass and I am sure there is someone out there that will be a good match for you.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I wish you the very best .<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You must be very frustrated from feeling unable to do something.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",I remember when my mother was having end of life mental declining issues. I understand feeling as if the person is changing and having unusual moods and mood swings. Do you have anyone you can talk to?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",You are feeling the way anybody in your situation would fee like. It must be helpful to have a husband who listens and can be supportive when he is there. Have you always had sleep issues?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",Being upset can make someones mind race and make it really difficult to rest or get any sleep at all. Have you ever gone through anything like this before?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I can relate to being close to someone who is addicted. It can feel very sad and lonely at times. I would want to change the person in my life but just has to learn to let go instead. It is a process that takes years to learn.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Yes, I understand how it can feel like our children are always our babies and we want to fix everything for them. Sometimes it feels like we can change them or re raise them if we just do more for them. Have you had the chance to speak to a close friend or pastor about this situation?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"You are very self aware and have good insight. I notice that you are very in touch with your feelings. You can use writing as a way to release emotions and express yourself, as you are now.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Yes, I can recommend a journal on Amazon that I also use. Thank you for sharing with me today. Please reach back out anytime.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thank you!<|endoftext|>
Question,oh! did you search for new job?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,yes i know its hard but try maybe you can get quickly if you find new.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,i mean if you apply for new job you can get quickly. then you can come out from this depression.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance",yes its difficult situation for everyone because of this pandemic. but try for online job.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,try to come out from depression because its not good for your health.<|endoftext|>

"Others,Self-disclosure",your welcome. thanks for sharing your problem.<|endoftext|>
Others,Your welcome.<|endoftext|>
Others,bye good to talk with you.<|endoftext|>
Others,Hello! My name is Joe. It's nice to meet you! How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm so sorry to hear that! Is there anything specific going on that is stressing you out?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds to me like COVID-19 in general is causing you a lot of stress. Does this sound accurate to you?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I also have a compromised immune system, so I understand where you're coming from. All of this has been very scary.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know it's tough, but I believe that if we all keep working together and talking through our feelings, we can make it through this!<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Information,Providing Suggestions","I live alone as well and also need to take care of myself. It can be so hard at times. I found that spending less time on social media and less time watching the news has helped my anxiety level to an extent. I don't think you should completely stop listening to what's going on as it's important to stay informed, but for me, limiting the amount of time that I spend engaging in these activities really helped. Have you thought about limiting how much time you spend tuning into news sources and especially on social media? I know it's hard because there isn't much to do.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions",Have you considered spending your time engaging in other hobbies? I've been doing a lot of arts and crafts (one in particular called diamond painting that can be ordered directly from Amazon) and also reading novels that I can also have delivered right to my door. This also prevents me from having to go out in public. Talking to me about how you're feeling is a great start! I'm proud of you for being open and honest about what's going on in your head. It's very easy for people to get stuck inside of their own minds right now. Another suggestion I've been mentioning to others suffering from the mental stressors that COVID-19 is causing is considering speaking to an outpatient/occupational therapist. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions","You're welcome! I'm more than happy to provide any help that I can. I'd also very highly recommend finding hobbies that you enjoy, even if arts and crafts or reading aren't your thing. Can you think of anything else that would help you to keep your mind off everything going on? I've also found that guided meditation (you can find a lot of these for free on YouTube) helps to calm my mind down at night and allows me to get a really good night's sleep.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Reflection of feelings",You're very welcome! I hope that some of the things that I suggested help you to get through all of this. It seems as though you're feeling very similar to how I've been feeling.<|endoftext|>
Others,"How has the weather been where you are? Sometimes, just getting outside for a brief walk alone or even just for a few minutes to get some fresh air can really be helpful.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Others","I found a few months ago that the more time I spent watching the news and following COVID-19, the more depressed and anxious I got. I decided that I'd spend 30 minutes twice per week catching up on what's going on in my local area and around the globe. Other than that, I try not to focus on it as much as I can. Wow, it must be beautiful there! I'm in Pennsylvania.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So you are having trouble with Virtual school being so hard and it's causing you stress, am I understanding correctly?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",I remember being in your position. I know it's very hard and I am so sorry that you are stressed.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know you said you want to quit, but hang in there!<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It sounds like you have always done well with school, this virus has made it to where so many people are struggling. Just chatting with you, I can feel how stressed and anxious about it you are!<|endoftext|>"
Information,I know that the situation with virtual learning is out of your control when it comes to how long it will last but is there anything you could do to relieve your stress while you are trying to learn things yourself?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others",When you start feeling stressed maybe you could try deep breathing for a few minutes to relax again. Or take a quick break and get some fresh air? Is there anything else that you do in any other situation that would normally help you relax?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Oh wow that would make things complicated! But yes the deep breathing would definitely help, I'm sure!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe you could reward yourself with a spa trip ever so often, since you enjoy it?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hi, how are you today?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","I see, I've been feeling that way too recently. Is there anything in particular that has you upset or just life in general?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","That makes total sense. Covid's been going on for so long, life is so different now. Do you want to talk about what's going on with your mom?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",I think it's really great that you're doing all that for her! It must be extra hard to have to limit public interactions even more than most people. That sounds so stressful to have to be worried about her on top of everything else. I'm so sorry you're going through that. Have you been able to keep in contact with friends through video chat? That's something that can sometimes help when feeling isolated.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It sounds like you don't think the online interactions are a good substitute for in-person things. Does that sound right? Ah, that sounds like kind of a cycle of guilt going on. Where she feels bad about you not being able to go out, and you feel bad about her feeling bad.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yeah that makes complete sense. It seems like you have a good idea of who you are and what your needs are.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I wonder if you could do something like take walks in the park with friends, or see them with masks where you're really socially distanced from everyone.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I really hope things get better for you. Covid should be ending soon hopefully with the vaccine, and things will start to go a bit back to normal.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others",Yeah! I hope that works out for you. I've been finding getting outside and doing things with others has been helpful both for social and exercise. It's been really nice chatting with you :).<|endoftext|>
Others,Hi! How are you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,It sounds like you might be upset. Can you tell me what’s going on?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That sounds difficult and stressful. What do you do when you see it happening?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you?<|endoftext|>
Question,That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I see. How long has this been going on and is this a daily occurrence or does it happen at certain times?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I can sense your frustration. It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue.  Do you think that might help?<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control  over how you are able to interact with people. I wish you the best in dealing with this and hope you begin to feel better about it soon, especially entering into a new year!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Hi there.  How's it going?<|endoftext|>
Question,What's going on?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Divorce is tough.  Have been through it myself. Especially tough, I would imagine, in these times.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you have any support in the area you live in?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I'm glad you reached out.  Having support is something we all need.  Zoom and being far away isn't the ideal support I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Most definitely.  I'm far away from my family too so Zoom and phone calls have been great despite the long distance.  Have you visited your family since Covid began?<|endoftext|>
Question,"That's awesome!  I'm planning on going to visit mine next Summer.  Are you able to see them before years end?  If not, maybe early next year? Hopefully Covid will be just a memory.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What state do they live in?<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you wanting to move back there?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Best of luck to you.  Hope things turn around for you!<|endoftext|>
Others,Hello!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Why are you not feeling very good about yourself, lately?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand how you feel. All will be well, you are going to be okay.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So, just from my understanding you are a single mom and your friends have distant from you because oh this?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like its been really tough for you and wish you had more support from your friends and even your child's father.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I myself am single mum so I understand how you feel. You will find also that there are many others dealing with this issue so you are not alone.<|endoftext|>
Information,"What go me through those difficult times was seeking for counselling also I had family that were very supportive and helpful. The father of my child did not pay child support at first so I took him to court eventually and he was forced to start paying child support, so financially things got better.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others",What about your family members are they able to help look after your child whilst you work? You are welcome.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I understand that.  The pandemic has been very hard to keep connected with everyone. Have you tried talking to your friends about how you are feeling?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It's completely normal to feel like that. I have been in your exact shoes.  I would suggest inviting one of them out for lunch or dinner and express face to face how you are feeling right now.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,She may be going through something at home or having family issues.  We truly never know what the other person is going through unless we have that uncomfortable situation. My suggestion would be to rephrase that question slightly to her.<|endoftext|>
Question,"It's completely natural.  Instead of texting her, have you tried calling?<|endoftext|>"
Question,How long have you been friends?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You both have been friends for such a long time.  I'm so jealous of friendships like that. I would definitely ask her for lunch.  You all have been through so much together. This conversation with her would be a weight off your shoulders.<|endoftext|>
Information,"I do not think she would respond that way at all. Once she sees that this has you concerned about your friendship, she will take it serious and open up to you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I'm an only child as well so I understand how you are feeling :). you are welcome! Glad I could help!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yes! It can be frustrating at times. But it sounds like you have a plan in order. You just need to execute it.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You as well!<|endoftext|>
Question,No problem! How can I help you?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So from what I am understanding, you have been applying for jobs and you are having anxiety about finding one and waiting through the application process.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Just from the few messages we have shared I can tell how anxious this is making you.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I just recently went through a layoff at my company, and I had the same situation trying to find another job. It is very stressful.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,What have you done to reach out for feedback from the companies? Often it helps to send e-mails or make phone calls to have them give you some feedback.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions",I think that would be a great start! It also might help to get business cards from the people you interview with in order to be able to reach out to them in the future.<|endoftext|>
Question,What type of work are you interested in?<|endoftext|>
Information,"I think that would be a great idea! It has been shown that people with higher level degrees make more money and have more opportunity than those without,.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I think learning a trade would also be a great idea! I would definitely reach out to see where you can start that process.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","From our conversation so far, I can tell you are extremely anxious about this whole situation. I know how stressful.it can be, but I know you can get through it!<|endoftext|>"
Others,How are you.<|endoftext|>
Question,What is happening at work that makes you feel likes that?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I see, is there anyone you could talk to at work that could possibly help you?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can see how that would be difficult. Maybe if there is something specific  you need help with, you could ask a coworker or senior staff.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Since you are relatively new it is understandable that it may be difficult.  I would see if there is someone I could confide in.  They may be understanding.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Is there something specific you are feeling you need more help with?  Maybe the people you are asking do not understand exactly what  you need help with.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is understandable.  I have been in situations where I had to make difficult decisions at my job too.  Overtime you will be gaining experience and it will most likely get easier or you'll get better.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"If there are situations you've found difficult, maybe you could practice making decisions in those circumstances, or ask coworkers what they have done in those times as well.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,You seem to care about this job and your performance.  I believe you will gain experience and confidence will come with it.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Your welcome.  I hope you are able to feel somewhat better about the situation at work, and feel at ease.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,Your welcome.  Are you feeling better?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You sound better.  Thank you too!<|endoftext|>
Others,Welcome.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I understand. During these times, it is very stressful.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Whenever I am stressed, I like to go for a walk and listen to music. It helps take me away and reflect for a while.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Music is a great stress relief! Excercise is great too, for releasing those happy endorphins! Both music and exercise really help me deal with my stress levels!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You are having stress in your family as well?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Personally, I enjoy hip hop/ rap or anything upbeat. It puts me in a great mood and makes me feel strong.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I understand. Trying some options to work through stress can be very helpful for you.<|endoftext|>
Information,"Yes, we all have stress. Learning to deal with it is the key!<|endoftext|>"
Question,You have children? How many?<|endoftext|>
Others,They are a blessing!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Absolutely!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Doctors can help by prescribing medicine for stress, if you feel like nothing is helping. I have suffered with anxiety for years. It was affecting my blood pressure and I finally had to go to a doctor for anxiety medicine. It has helped me. I still exercise though. It makes me feel great! I enjoy dance fitness!<|endoftext|>"
Question,How may I help you today?<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you tried to talk to your kids about that?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe that will be a good thing because it might make them wished they had listened to you and won't do it again,.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",Everything will be okay. Try to talk to them and be very firm with them.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,How about reward them with something if they listen and behave.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Don't get to hard on yourself everything will be okay.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yes maybe that will work for them and probably want to be outside.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I understand the corona has messed everything up this year.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",are they having a good Christmas. No i have no kids but want some one day.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Information",Right i understand that. Just talk to them and be firm with them that will get them to listen more. Your welcome. Have a awesome Christmas to and stay safe to.<|endoftext|>
Question,I am well. What's going on?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So it seems like you have been noticing some distance between you and a friend and it also seems like he/she is not putting as much as effort into your relationship as you are. It seems at times that you put in all the work and that it's one-sided. Does that sound about right?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",This must be very hard on you. How does this make you feel?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how I feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant. I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think that is a good approach. You will get through this!<|endoftext|>
Others,Anytime. I hope your feeling even a little better. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<|endoftext|>

Question,What seems to be going on in your marriage?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can understand how you are feeling marriage is hard for some.<|endoftext|>
Others,Communication is key in a marriage.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others",do not let this get the best of you. there are ups and downs in marriage but you have to be able to work through all that with your partner. no i am not married but one day i do want to get married.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know you will two will be able to work through this together.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I am sorry to hear and i understand how you are feeling my parents recently got a divorce.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions,Information",i can understand but you know you just have to move on with life and not let that get in the way especially your marriage. both of you need to try to sit down and have a talk about the marriage and let your partner know how you are feeling and see how your partner is feeling. without communication then it will be hard to get through a marriage.<|endoftext|>
Information,when there is no communication then that is when the trouble starts and the marriage starts failing.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,find the right time to talk to your partner and just explain to your feelings towards what is going on and let your partner know you do not like what is going on.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,if that does not help try to seek help from a marriage counselor i have heard they have saved many marriages from failing.<|endoftext|>
Others,Your welcome.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",I'm sorry to hear about that! I can totally understand why you'd be stressed. Is it for certain that you will lose your job?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can feel your anxiety, and I completely understand why you're feeling that way, but you don't know for sure that will be true. Have you started looking for a new job already?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It definitely sounds like you're being overwhelmed with a lot of responsibilities along with your job loss. It's definitely a lot of things to deal with all at once, but it would help to break things down so they're more manageable. Do you have anyone close by who can help you out?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I understand completely. I used to bottle things up too, but I've learned that the people who love you won't think you're a burden if you ask for help or just to have someone blow off some steam. Changes are definitely scary, but they can also be a great opportunity to do something different. Is there anything you want to try doing?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you're very self-aware and I think your friends and family will be very willing to lend a hand.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes, your family, friends, and health are all really important! I hope you stay safe!<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,i understand. have you had a talk with him about his progress in school and tell explain to him why school is important.<|endoftext|>
Information,yes being firm with a child will sometimes help them understand.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others",also i remember when i was in school my parents did this thing to where they would reward me with a toy or going to my favorite place if i got good grades and that actually worked for me it made me want to do my work and get good grades. sometimes something like that will help with children and sometimes it wont.<|endoftext|>
Others,you should see how that goes and take it from there.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Self-disclosure","ah yes lockdown...I don't want to guess how you are feeling, can you explain how you are feeling please? I know I have been finding it really challenging.<|endoftext|>"
Others,okay.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Restatement or Paraphrasing",hmm I don't understand the question can you rephrase please? it sounds like you are asking why I want to help people?<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","the lockdown has been depressing for me too, I can relate to how you are feeling.  We are coming out of it soon that's all that keeps me going. does she ask your advice?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Does she ask you for advice or do you offer it without her asking?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I see....so it sounds like she asked your advice, you gave her your advice, but she didn't follow it...<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","Maybe she needs time to think over all of her options for herself, maybe it would help if you are patient while she does. ok.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,i am going for a walk later...I live in Ontario CAnada....it's a bit cool and windy today but I try to get out every day. we just entered another lockdown here.<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi :) Is there anything you'd like to talk about? Something on your mind?<|endoftext|>
"Information,Others","Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!).<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you have been getting some assistance?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope.<|endoftext|>
Question,That would be incredibly immoral of him. Do you feel that he is likely to do such a  thing?<|endoftext|>
Others,That is a very rational way to look at things. I really hope that it does not come to thank though! Thank you for talking and I wish you all the best for the coming months.<|endoftext|>
Others,I am glad that you'd not roll over and accept ill treatment! Well done :).<|endoftext|>
Others,I am afraid I need to leave now but thank you for talking :) (can you press the quit button and take the survey?) Best wishes!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You too!<|endoftext|>
Question,I see you are having some anxieties about your future and job applications.  When did this start?<|endoftext|>

Question,Can you explain to me what exactly kind of game it was?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,ok so your director played a game she was not allowed to play and she got caught playing it and quit her job is that correct?<|endoftext|>
Question,So you are scared that you might get in trouble?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I am so sorry you are going through this and i know how you are feeling.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,you should not have anything to worry about as long as you did not play the game then you will be fine and you will not get in trouble or your boss will not see that as a problem.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would just suggest you to have no contact with her right now until all this passes.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would also have a talk with your boss about the situation and let him know how you are feeling.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Providing Suggestions",Did you see your director playing the game? I would not bring up about you wanting her job just yet give it a couple of days.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"You as well, keep up the great work!<|endoftext|>"
Others,I am happy to help.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you want to talk about whats going on right now?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Ive done some things like that before. I know this might sound weird but what helped me through it was to actually own it. Take control of it before they can.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yea that is definitely one way to control it.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Ha, well that could get interesting.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Not yet to be honest.<|endoftext|>
Others,I think we have to have 10 rounds of talking? Maybe we can just say goodbye and it will be enough heh.<|endoftext|>
Others,OK sounds good.<|endoftext|>
Others,"No problem, have a good one!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So you are experiencing problems at work? Please tell me about it, I am happy to listen.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"I am very sorry to hear that - trouble with workmates, especially those who are in a higher position, can make things very miserable can't they?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Have you considered going over her head and putting in a complaint? Especially if she is making everyone else miserable as well. Someone more senior might be able to do something.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Please try to stay positive - bullies never prosper in the long term. I think that you need to talk to your co-workers about this and see if you can come to some sort of arrangement between you. Alternatively, have you ever considered seeking another job? I know that that might feel like selling out but you might be happier somewhere else.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,I feel that that is fair enough. You should not be working to make up for her failures and I hear you saying that you feel that this is w hat is happening?<|endoftext|>
Others,(sorry was afk give me a second to catch up :)). I really feel that you have grounds for a formal complaint. Just her being incapable is bad enough but bullying too is unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Anonymous reporting sounds like a good thing, as long as it's not being abused. This sounds like a very good time to use it though. I hope I have been able to give you some good advice here!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You are most welcome, enjoy your day!<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am sorry.  What is going on?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you feel like they don't want to be around you and have nobody to talk to?<|endoftext|>
Question,You prefer it that way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I follow you.  It is hard to see people outside of usual social circles right now with the pandemic going on.  Out of curiosity tell me what you like doing with others?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I can understand that. I have not seem my own friends for almost a year because of COVID-19.  It felt isolated and lonely.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It has not been easy but I focused on myself.  I started doing more exercise and weight lifting.  I took up learning how to invest money, and I also got into the habit of reading. Basically I build myself up in body, wallet, and mind so I feel better about myself progressively.   It worked well for me at least.  What do you think might help you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?<|endoftext|>
Others,Whatever works for you. All the best and stay safe.<|endoftext|>
Others,Bye.<|endoftext|>
Others,"Hi, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am sorry to hear that. What is going on?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So you are worried you may lose your job due to the pandemic, is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It seems to me from chatting with you that you are extremely anxious about the situation.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I completely understand as I was in the same situation when the pandemic started and I wasn't sure if I was going to keep my job.<|endoftext|>
Question,What industry do you currently work in?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know this is an extremely hard situation, but I know you can make it through it!<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","Yes, we are currently in a lock down. Have you had a talk with your supervisor about the situation?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Something I used to do when I was struggling with anxiety over this was come home and play video games, which is something I really enjoy doing. Have you tried to really dive into more activities that you enjoy?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I play a lot of sports games, mostly racing.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I'm so sorry that you are feelingly lonely. If I may ask you a question, when did this start?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Were you feeling lonely before the virus came this year?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds that you are feeling lonely because you cannot talk to people face to face. Do I have that right?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","I WFH as well. It can be very liberating, but oftentimes I feel lonely too. Do you have more than one job that you do at home?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I know that it's really difficult right now, but it seems that the virus is going to get better in the new year. We need to push through these next few months and then it will be over.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Yes, I do feel that way. And yes I will take the vaccine.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions","Apparently, the side effects are usually minimal and temporary if you have them at all. The people that are having severe reactions have had issues with vaccines previously. I would keep an open mind. It might help to ease your anxiety about the future. There are going to be several vaccines to choose from eventually.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like you're being selfish because you're not going to take the vaccine. Does that seem like a reasonable conclusion?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes, I do. It's not bothersome and it's the least I can do to keep myself and others safe.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You as well!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I see, It's been a difficult year for all of us. But I think it would be possible to negotiate.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job?<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Okay then, It's good that you already started. But first of all stop being panicked.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions","And remember, what are we if we stop fighting? Your friends can support you emotionally at least and maybe they know a person that could help you.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Others","Life is full of surprises, but we should get advantage of bad situations. It's totally fine to be afraid, but also at the same time     you should try harder to reach your goal.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Courage is not the absence of the fear, you should fight to find your place.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Yeah that's the spirit. You can and you should get a job, so start right now!<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","Don't let the stress and fear overcome you, get control and who knows maybe you get a better job. your so welcome dear, I hope I could help you even a little bit.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Boy, that's a tough one. You've got to handle a problem like that pretty diplomatically. Have you talked to your co-worker, the one the boss hits on?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"That's a good question, and I don't know the answer. It depends on your HR department. Have you suggested that the co-worker talk to HR? Is there an anonymous system for filing complaints?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's a good attitude. You want to be supportive and helpful. You sound like a good co-worker. Remember that the problem did not start with you, so you do not need to feel responsible for it.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That's a good question. I would show support for her and empathize with her and her situation. Do you have lunch with her? Can you send her a text letting her know she's valued? She might appreciate that.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Ok. That's a good first step. I think you have a way forward with this. Maybe after a few texts, you can sit down and talk about solutions in detail, like going to HR.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That's a good positive step. I think that you've got a pretty handle on the situation. Good for you!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I understand that you're frustrated and sad. I would feel the same way too. I think that anyone else in your situation would feel the same way.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well, you have to do what is right for yourself. If you find a better job, think seriously about taking it. Your co-worker will not be there forever. You have a responsibility to yourself.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome! I'm glad that I was able to help you!<|endoftext|>
Others,"You too! Have a great day, and good luck with work!<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hello, how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Bad days can be rough, can you tell me more about it?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I know I have had days like that when things seem hopeless but things always get better!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I know it can be overwhelming when you have so much to do but I am confident you can overcome this!<|endoftext|>
Others,Have you ever considered trying to get a planner in order to schedule your time? I really think this would help you feel less stressed.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That sounds like a great idea, having a friend like that really puts a positive spin on things. You could also consider the dollar tree, they have planners for only a dollar.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I think that would be great idea, exercise and fresh air normally helps me when I have been in a bad mood.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I am so glad I was able to help you come to a solution! You will be back on track before you know it. I use a planner myself and this is the only way I am able to keep everything done!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You are very welcome! I am glad I helped!<|endoftext|>
Others,"Hello, How are you?<|endoftext|>"
Others,That is wonderful to hear. How is life going?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Oh I know how hard it can be to be stressed out. What is going on with your job?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Oh yeah, not being able to find a job can be pretty stressful. Have you checked online, on job websites?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Oh yes, that happens most of the time when applying for jobs. It's okay, you will definitely find one. Have you tried asking friends/ family? Maybe places that friends and family work at, have job openings.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Of course! Everyone deserves to have a job that they worked hard for. What kind of jobs are you interested in?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","Oh okay, well while looking for job try not to put yourself in position where you take deep breaths and let your mind at piece. Patience is everything. Sometime in life we all have our patience tested, but that is OK because at the end the results are better than anything. I mean try to put yourself in that position.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","Of course! Everything comes at a perfect time, and we have to learn to be patient, and while waiting we can indulge in other activities that we like. While doing your online job maybe you can work in activities that build experience for a job you want to do next time.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That is a great idea! You are working hard and that hard work is going to pay off! Just try to relax and be patient, which can help with your stress.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Of course! I love to help.<|endoftext|>
Others,Goodbye and have a wonderful day!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Has trouble relaxing been an ongoing issue?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It can be difficult to balance things like that, I feel you.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It must be stressful.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That sounds hard.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,With all that ambition I'm sure you will find a way.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Is there anyone you trust that you can ask for help?<|endoftext|>
Information,There are a lot of counselors available that might be able to help you manage your time to the max.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I've taken on too much at one time before but I still found a way through. I bet you can too.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You are welcome. Never give up!<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope that helps and good luck!!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Oof, that is a very difficult situation.  I'm sorry you're going through that.  How do you feel about it?<|endoftext|>"
Question,What do your parents say when/if you tell them you want to be done with school?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"That's not a fair thing for them to say to their child.  I will say that there are academic programs that combine travel and credits, but you probably know that already.  And I don't think you should have to compromise anyway.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I cannot tell you what to do exactly, but I would encourage you to fulfill yourself before anyone else's dictation of your life.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I think you need to be prepared for them to not be happy with your honest opinion, but that just because they aren't happy with it doesn't mean it's wrong.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Keep in mind that from their point of view, they want the best for you because they love you, so try not to burn the bridge or salt the earth.  I had a rocky relationship with my dad after college too, but it's better now.  They will survive, and you will thrive.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"That feeling is totally understandable, I felt the same way.  They need to let you find your own way, it's apart of growing up.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"The anger is understandable, but I think it is slightly misplaced as they are not trying to hurt you.  You are frustrated by their lack of understanding and their judgement of your choices, but you and they are both attempting to solve the same problem of your happiness.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That's very kind of you to say, thank you :-).<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You are a great listener and have a lot of passion, I think you will be successful for sure.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You too!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Taking finals certainly is tough, there's so much to think about. What's bothering you the most?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you spoken to anyone at the college about this?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It must make you feel quite trapped knowing that the college aren't cutting you a bit of slack considering you are still recovering from a serious illness. It sounds like you are trying your best and not giving up already.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"It's good to hear that you're not giving up. Sometimes in these situations, you just have to do your best and then at least you know you did what you could. I like to tell myself in these situations that if there are no other avenues to explore, you just have to 'go with the flow' and don't beat yourself up thinking about it over and over - if there's nothing you can do, just do your best to ride it out.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"If you tried hard previously then you may come out the other end having done very well!  When I was at school a long time ago, I had to stay off school for a month, when they were practising the exams. I didn't get chance to do those and I thought 'wow I'm totally screwed here', but guess what? I did okay!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes, I'm here.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It's totally understandable. I think even without the COVID situation, you would still be anxious. It's totally natural. Not that that discounts how you feel. Do you agree?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well, I've tried meditating a few times before which doesn;t take it all away, it just takes the edge off! I used a guided meditation app. I also listened to white noise when I went to sleep as I was having trouble sleeping. I find even if you're mind is just taken away from it all for a few minute, it can re-balance you a little.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe you should do more of that, it sounds like a good idea? Don't feel guilty for doing so either as it acts as a 'medicine'. If the 'medicine' works then take it.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Sounds like a plan! It's certainly worth giving it a go. We need a break from it all sometimes or we'd all go mad.<|endoftext|>
Question,I am okay thanks but it is a worrying year. Have you been worrying about anything?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Ah I hear you, I have been self isolating too. Do you have an online support network?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Well, friends you can talk to during this difficult time? I have a lot of friends on facebook and similar that I can talk to.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Sometimes it does just make it easier to know that other people are in the same situation as you :).<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Yes .. or at least share coping mechanisms perhaps? Do you have any hobbies that you can occupy yourself with right now?<|endoftext|>
Question,Could you perhaps set up Zoom meetings where you could play together online?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,No I don't think so :) I think that it is totally live so you could play just as you would if you were together in person.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I hope it goes well for you. It has been such an awful year, hasn't it?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I wish you all the very best for 2021. I hope that you get to get together with your band again and rock!<|endoftext|>
Others,"Yes, all we need to do is be patient! Have a great New Year and thanks for talking.<|endoftext|>"
Others,What's your name?<|endoftext|>
Question,Hi Shay. You are welcome.  Anything on your mind today? I'm here if you would like to talk about anything.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance",So you are feeling depressed and lonely and you feel unimportant? I am sorry to hear that you are feeling this way. I have felt the same before and I know it can be difficult to change those feelings.<|endoftext|>
Question,I can understand that.  If I may can I ask you if you live with anyone?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Ok well that should be something that you can take pride in.  Do you have contact with your friends and family?  I have found that for me calling my mom or chatting with my friends that truly know me makes me feel more connected to others.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That's great that you speak to your mom.  I know it can be hard to open yourself up and meet new friends but I think you can do it.  Are there maybe some people at your job that you would consider making friends with?  I think that would be a great place to start because you would already have something in common.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,OK I see.  So for now you would like to be able to get comfort from the people that already know you and your story.  One suggestion that I have would be to really try to reach out and contact those people.  I know that with work and life in general it is easy to lose touch.  Not that you stop caring for a person but things just get hetic from time to time.<|endoftext|>
Question,"i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I see i am sorry that it has you feeling down, did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,maybe you could send him a message on social media and let him know the argument has your feelings hurt and you would like to try to talk about it when he has time.<|endoftext|>
Question,how long have you been friends with him?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over. Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Reflection of feelings","I would  start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question",I would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much. do you have any hobbies?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"from chatting with you seem like a nice person, try not to let it get you down.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,i am glad i could be of some help!<|endoftext|>
Others,you are welcome.<|endoftext|>
Others,bye.<|endoftext|>
Question,what is the problem you are facing. what is the problem you are facing.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,so you are saying that your grade is low and your professor is not listening to you.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"that's terrible, have you go through a lecturer that you are at least close to.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","i had an issue like that with my supervisor. He wouldn't schedule a meeting or reply my mail, not until i went to a lecturer they all know. i can feel your stress, just take it easy with your self.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"yes, should mail or call him, leave a voice note if need be, tell him that you will take it up if he didn't respond to you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"yes, it is holiday season. Have a nice holiday first and face the issue head on after.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"once everyone sees that you have been trying to get in touch with him but he refuse to respond, then your case is already favored.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,you are welcome. you are doing the right thing because this involves your future.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","I am really sorry to hear that your going through that right now, What happened tonight ? was there an argument.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I totally understand having financial issues , this is a hard time for so many people. I am sensing that this has been esspecially hard on your relationship, did one of you lose a job?<|endoftext|>"
Others,This time of year can be really tough and stressfull. Have you looked into government funded programs for support?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"there are lots of things you can do , I have been having hard time myself. I had my work hours myself and have had to get creatuve ti stay aflot.<|endoftext|>"
Information,there are many local agencies to help with things ike rent and electric.<|endoftext|>
Information,"yes! also , there are many panties around most cities and local churches that help with that stuff.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","with the recent change in our economy i have found that there are many places willing to help , things are not hopless and it sounds like you are motuvated. motivated.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","thats great !! in the meantime, have you tried talking to your partner about the situation and asking her to help out ? it sounds to me like you are willing to do what it takes to be sucsessfull.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","oh im sorry to hear that, how does that make you feel? also there are also many midfullness activities you can use to reduce your level of stress and axiety like meditation. its really hard to do everything all by yourself. It seems like you are a good person with a good heart.<|endoftext|>"
Question,What has made you feel anxious?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I am very sorry to hear that. I am currently in a situation where furloughs are greatly affecting my family as well.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are you given specifics on time of furlough?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure",I know that's very difficult. And no doubt why you're here working for crumbs. It's why I'm here as well.<|endoftext|>
Question,I know it's a difficult time. Yes Uber is definitely overrun right now. Have you taken any time out to address your anxiety so it doesn't become more serious?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, that's definitely an expense you can't afford right now. But are you familiar with the concept of controlled breathing to help reduce or relieve anxiety?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Not exactly. Controlled breathing is more of getting yourself into a quiet room. Closing your eyes, and purposely and intently focusing on your breathing. Slowly breathe in for a count of 5, then slowly exhale for a count of 5. Repeat this process for approximately 10 minute. It will help your stress levels and help regulate your heart rate!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I've been using it myself over the past 3 months and it most definitely helps! But it's absolutely imperative to clear your mind and have complete quiet.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,No problem. I hope this gives you some relief! Stay strong!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"My final piece of advice would be to set aside time that is specified where nothing negative is discussed. No politics, no bills, nothing anxiety producing for you. It's probably best if this time is within an hour of your bedtime becuase anxiety is not conducive to a good night's sleep.<|endoftext|>"
Others,No problem. Take care. Wishing you well on your situation.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello, how are you today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,I am doing well. Is anything troubling you?<|endoftext|>
Question,Would you like to share?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Yes I am here to listen.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",It sounds like your friends can be judgmental and even though they are joking it ends up upsetting you. I have been in a similar situation. I always expected my friends to support and understand me but sometimes they made fun of the way I am. Have you ever talked to your friends about this? Have you expressed how it made you feel?<|endoftext|>
Information,From what I have seen if we avoid expressing our feelings they keep building up and can make us depressed.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can tell that this bothers you a lot.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I have found that being honest and expressing our true feelings helps us and helps others understand us.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It is not easy but you can do it. Everyone needs friends.<|endoftext|>
Others,No problem. Enjoy the rest of your day.<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you been feeling this way for a while or is it a surprise change?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So you have felt for a while that things aren't right in your relationship and you don't know how to end the relationship without hurting your girlfriend's feelings?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can tell that you are a nice person that cares for your girlfriend and you want the best for her. I think you want to be honest with her which is a good sign of maturity and integrity.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Unfortunately this may be upsetting in the short term. I had a friend who had a similar issue. He wanted to end things with his girlfriend and they ended up having an honest conversation, which was upsetting at the time but they are still friends to this day and parted on good terms.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I think the best thing to do would just be honest about your feelings and start the conversation with her. I think you could also consider when is the right time to do this so that you minimise the affect that this may have on her.<|endoftext|>
Information,"People who have a negative experience at a key point in their lives, such as a birthday of Christmas, tend to remember that bad experience the following year. I mean choose an appropriate time to have the discussion.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Yes when she is available to have a good talk about this. Do you have my friends that you can talk to about this?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I think it's best to be honest and if it comes from the heart then you can at least say you have been honest with yourself and your girlfriend.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think you can do this and have confidence that you will do it in the right way. These things are not easy but I know you can ride to the challenge and do this tactfully and with care.<|endoftext|>

"Others,Question",I hope you are having a good Christmas Eve! Are you feeling down about something?<|endoftext|>

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Okay thats completely normal! What are your interests/what do you like to do? Thats a good starting question.<|endoftext|>

Others,Well it seems no matter what you can't go wrong. Do you want to talk about anything else?<|endoftext|>
Others,Okay well have a good day!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That must be hard to not be with friends so much. Being social is human.<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you tried calling them to express your concerns?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds like you are trying.  Have you expressed to them why you feel the way you do?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,That can be hard when there are different viewpoints on such a big issue.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you think that having a friend intervene and having a third party help out could help?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings",That sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you are thinking of alternate paths to work through the friendship.  Your friend will appreciate all the efforts you are making to show you care.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you think your friends would like a card?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,My mother-in-law often sends cards for each holiday because she can't leave her home due to illness.  I know deep down she cares even though she is not in person.<|endoftext|>

Others,And he has always had cocky attitude? Have you ever told him that?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I understand your frustration, it's upsetting when they dismiss what you say even though you have been friends for so long.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"What I would recommend in this case is, spend more time with other friends who appreciate you. You also need to tell Rick your honest thought, don't beat around the bush but let him know you're serious.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I have been in the same situation myself, what I usually do is sit down with them and start the conversation in a serious mood. Explain everything I need to say and tell them that I mean every word. If they don't seem to accept and change, I keep my distance from them.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"That's even easier to make it clear, if you run into him, just give him a polite greetings. The point is, make it clear you have had enough.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes. Be not too harsh at first. I would say to give him 1 more chance. If he still doesn't respect your words, it's the best for both to say it clearly.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You have the right mindset! Practice before talking will help you deliver your thoughts better.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I would start with something along the line ""Look, I  know we have had this conversation many times. However, i feel as though you never take me seriously. I want to say this one last time...."".<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Getting emotional is totally fine, that's why you need practice.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"When i feel like everything is out of control, i try to focus on small tasks that i can complete with ease. Maybe you can focus on setting up quarantine room, or getting medication and food to last for those weeks just in case. Worst case out of that is that you have some extra food and medicine.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Well for one my house has never been so spotless ha. I have been exercising more, going for more walks with my dog, having more family nights, just anything really that can take my mind of it.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I did not want to let my fears control me. Believe me the first month or so i did just that. I just wanted to feel better. I started small, cleaning one room at a time. Making a small list to get done. Sooner than later the lists got longer, the place got cleaner.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I made one starting with the easiest jobs first.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Have you ever wanted to try a new hobby? Knitting, woodworking, anything really?<|endoftext|>"

I mean if things get heated always good to give everyone space. Well i do love last house on the left, but that is a little dark and i think were trying to steer away from that.<|endoftext|>"

"Others,Restatement or Paraphrasing",Hello. So you lost your job that is why you are sad right?<|endoftext|>
Question,Okay so what kind of job was it? And why do you think you lost your job?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Okay yes I agree with you I was also trying to find a new job since I had more time after graduating.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Okay since you are trying to find a new job you could try to learn some new techniques online. So you could put that on your resume to keep you from feeling sad.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings",Oh that is good. That will make you different from other people so when government opens up it will be easier for you to get in. So I would say to keep your hope up by trying to learn new things so you do not feel sad.<|endoftext|>

"Others,Providing Suggestions",What was he in NYC for? Have you tried getting counseling together?<|endoftext|>

Question,How does your boyfriend handle it?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That's such a hard position to be in. I am so so sorry that you need to go through this. I think trying to get them to therapy would be realaly amazing for both of you. Maybe you can incentivize your son to go somehow.<|endoftext|>

"Others,Providing Suggestions","sory abut that. I think you should talk to him logically. Think through all the reasons why you shold be together and how this can be resolved. Like, you won't use his card anymore and you can work on a budget together.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"Great, i think it will work out for you!! i have faith. I recently went through something similar nad it helped me.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"Hell, How can I help?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Initially, I used to feel like that and never shared my camera but I know I can do all the time.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,When I saw many people were sharing camera and they didnt care about anything - few sitting in room full of mess but they dint care.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions,Providing Suggestions",correct - it is just our mind thing which stops us not to share but once you start sharing you will feel confident. Once you dont care what people think you will be more confident. You will also be used to it.<|endoftext|>
Information,You can also try different backgrounds in Zoom which will improve the way you will look.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions",Correct - you can start with your colleagues and then slowly you will start sharing in other meetings. no problem - practice always helps. Start small and then go big.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am nearly 50 as well. People over 50s looks better and I am sure your appearance is good as well. It is just thinking.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It is all inside and outside appearance doesnt matter.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,All people over 50s are graceful - honest opinion.<|endoftext|>
Information,"No worries about anything and enjoy life. 100% agreed - Initially, all looks difficult but by the time all becomes easy and we become so used to it.<|endoftext|>"
Others,yes this will be over soon and we are also used to it.<|endoftext|>
Others,100% agreed - In person is always way better than remote.<|endoftext|>

Others,we just have to wait and follow all the guidelines.<|endoftext|>
Question,pls let me know if you need any help on sharing camera.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question,Reflection of feelings",Hi. How's it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Others,Others,Question","It sounds like you're having some cash flow issues, right? I can relate to that at a few more points in my life than I'd points in my life than I'd like to recall. It's so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift! That isn't all that common anymore, unfortunately.. Are you currently working?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn't increase along with inflation/cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially. Of course you'll need to put your rent and utilities above all else, and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift,.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I think that you will find out that all your parents really want is for you to be happy and to get to spend some quality family time with you. They love you and want you to be happy and healthy.That is a gift a lot of parents don't get, surprisingly..<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"It may sound cheesy to you,, but making a gift for someone is still one of the best ways to tell someone how much you really care. You were willing to give of yourself and your valuable time to actually create a gift.<|endoftext|>"
Question,That's good to hear. Can I encourage you in some way?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure","So you are unhappy at your job and want to do something else? What exactly are your fears? I have found writing out a pro and con list helps me -- On one side I look at the benefits, then I put the cons on the other side. They I weigh them, even if there are more cons, sometimes the PROS are much better.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can understand that looking for a job can be stressful and challenging at this time, but one thing is for certain, you will never know if you don't try.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I like the ""Do it afraid!"" method. I can still try even if I feel nervous.  You really do not need confidence to put your resume out there, you just need to do it afraid. And when I ""do it afraid"" I realize it was easier than I thought.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","I used to be paralyzed with self confidence, but the truth is, your confidence doesn't come from your job, your confidence comes from being a lovable person. The confidence that you are the person you want to be. It sounds optimistic but it is the truth, when I step out to perform, I'm always nervous. BEING nervous looking for a job, that is NORMAL. To expect to feel like you are super confident is unrealistic. Most people are nervous, but they do it anyway.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I always felt awkward and nervous looking for a job, I think I went to one interview calm and cool, in 30 years! Hahaha.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You have nothing to lose, really, you have weighed out that there is only good things that can come, but you think you must ""feel"" a certain way. You don not have to feel confident, you just have to do the work. For example, you don't FEEL like walking your dog, changing a diaper or helping someone, but you DO IT anyway.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Inter personal skills can be learned. I was very shy as a child and I learned how to be more friendly. And I was VERY shy.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","I'm very outgoing now. I had to learn a lot of skills to be this way and I like myself more too. Hahah. I'm old though, 59. You have nothing to lose, consider it a learning opportunity. Life is a journey. We all make mistakes in the past.  I think you are very intelligent actually because you thought of the pros and cons.  You just needed a boost.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I'm a lady! I pray to God and read the Bible and get wisdom there. Plus I have been to the school of hard knocks! lol. I'm a lady! I pray to God and read the Bible and get wisdom there. Plus I have been to the school of hard knocks! lol.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I look forward to your new job! And celebrate with you. Take deep breaths and forge ahead!!<|endoftext|>
Others,You are welcome! Thank you for sharing your life with me!<|endoftext|>
Others,"Helo, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are you feeling sort of depressed? I am sorry.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Would you feel happy if you think about after Covid, maybe next year?<|endoftext|>"
Question,have you been sleeping enough?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you like morning or night?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","Me too. I like morning too. Air feels fresh, although it is little contaminated here. At night time, I feel a little bit anxiety more. So I sleep really early. Sleeping feels good anyway? Do you feel ok while you're sleeping?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,I suggest listening to sad yet beautiful music. It sometimes helps me. Do you like classical music?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"When you are sad, listening to upbeat music may disturb you. Listening to instrumental music maybe good for you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I just checked YouTube and searched for some music. Good, I hope it will soothe your mind.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Is there something specific that has caused you to lose motivation? I am happy to listen.<|endoftext|>
Question,A lot of gyms have been closed due to the pandemic .. do you think that that knocked your schedule off kilter a bit?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",Yes it really does. I know that personally I am much less motivated to do anything at all than I was this time last year. Do you feel that there are other areas of your life that you are struggling with too?<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there a specific problem with school or is it just 2020 fatigue?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information","I do not know how long you have to go in school but if you have not done very much so far would you consider dropping out and perhaps training for a profession instead? Sometimes things can be more lucrative than just having a degree, if that makes sense.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Well I would say that if you've got as far as you have you might as well get the piece of paper. But the world is your oyster after that - you do not need to be tied to your field!<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Certainly I do not think there is any harm in the status quo being shaken up a little .. or indeed a lot!<|endoftext|>
"Others,Reflection of feelings",I totally agree. I am not totally sure what the solution is but I am hoping that there is one. Do you feel as though there is hope for the future though?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"When I was a student I sometimes felt that everyone else knew where they were going except me. But I later found out that everyone has some insecurities. That said, I am still not totally sure where I am going a quarter of a century in so I am perhaps not the best person to take advice from :D.<|endoftext|>"
Others,And to you too! You have to end it from your end ... I can't ;).<|endoftext|>
Question,What happened?<|endoftext|>
Others,Why did he break up with you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous.<|endoftext|>
Information,Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It's good for you to do that. You'll feel better with time.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I feel the same way. When it had happened with me. However, I talked it with my friends and family and made me feel much better.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,You should spend time for yourself now. Take care of yourself.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I Know that in the beginning it's so difficult to do anything, you just want to sleep and do nothing, but with time you'll feel much better and try start over.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Yes. you should do that. It's not good to hold crying. You should just do what you want to do now.<|endoftext|>
Others,"If you need anything later, just text me.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Bye.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I'm so sorry that happened. Are you mostly hurt because he didn't tell you he was seeing somebody else?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You must feel really torn up about it. I can tell that you care about your relationship.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe he didn't intend to hurt you. Its not like he invited you over to tease you. It is true that he didn't keep his promise, and that's his fault.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That would definitely add to the distress of the situation to have a weird surprise like that. It doesn't really seem like your fault that you were there but it is unfortunate nonetheless. Have you tried talking to h.im yet?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"That's ok, you have a vested interest in this person. It is natural to be interested in such things.<|endoftext|>"
Information,There are a lot of therapists out there that might be able to help you navigate this. It's OK to get some outside help.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Considering how much time you've put in to this relationship, I can tell you have a lot of feelings about all of this.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Really, it is no problem. It helps to let it out sometimes, I feel that. Make sure you take care of your own needs before starting to smooth things over.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thanks and you too, stay strong!<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Fare thee well sweetheart, best indeed.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Hello, how are you today.<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",I see. Sometimes that can happen when you look back on yourself. What is making you angry about the past?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I can personally relate to that myself. I have went through something similar like that 4 years ago. It can be very frustrating when it happens.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,The easiest thing that I did in my situation was obtained a new hobby. I took my anger out on my ex by joining Crossfit and interacted with that community. It helped me take my mind of from my ex.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Crossfit may not be for everyone, but do you think a new hobby may help you? Have you taken one in recently?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Painting is an excellent hobby. I can see that it's relaxing as well as help put your emotions into something physical.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It sounds like that you are doing great with your hobby. Have you try to interact with anyone else, such as an art community or your friends on your feedback?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yea, I can see why that may make you feel alone in that aspect. I thought about that myself, but there are groups that can help you out. Strangers in fact. I went on Reddit to express my frustrations and it can help to just let out your anger.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy. It is kind of like what we are doing right now to be honest. Again, it is not for everyone, but it does offer a group to talk to during this pandemic lol.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Only if you think it will help. Do you think it will?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"No problem. I really hope that I was able to help you at least. I am still available if you want to discuss further. Like I said, I know how it feels because my ex hid from me 2 years that she was seeing someone else, so I can relate with you.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Have a good day :).<|endoftext|>
Question,What makes you angry. Can you describe.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Oh  thats so sad. I am feeling very bad.<|endoftext|>

Question,"Would you mind possibly telling me a bit more about it? I am not all that familiar with that, and it does sound intriguing.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Question","I tend to worry at times too, and it almost always helps to talk about it with someone. Do you usually get along well with your parents?<|endoftext|>"
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure","It sounds to me like you're thinking that you've disappointed your parents by falling behind in class a little? I felt much the same way back when I was in college. My parents paid my way through school, and even got me to pursue a major that I had no interest in.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can tell you from personal experience and seeing others who've gone through similar events, your parents just may be a little upset right now, but they love you and really just want you to have a good and happy life. It sounds cheesy, I know, but it is actually true.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I know it may sound silly, but you may want to start meditating on a regular basis. It truly does make a big difference in the amount of stress and worrying that you will find yourself not doing nearly so often.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Affirmation and Reassurance,Others,Question","Studies on the benefits of meditation, mindfulness, and yoga have been pretty definitive in the fact that it drops people's stress levels, and thus their cortisol levels, and makes a real change for the better. I do it myself and it really has worked well for me. That's great! You'll be so glad that you did, I just know it. Please make sure you get back in touch with me to let me know if it was beneficial for you as well. You might also want to consider having an honest conversation about this with your parents. Are you able to have conversations like that with them?<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,Would you like to go into the reasons for why you are angry?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do they act this way often?<|endoftext|>
Information,"Well, everyone, including yourself, is entitled to an off day. Maybe something is going on with her she doesnt want to share. Or possibly even she is trying to share but doesnt know how.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps try to reach out and see if anything is wrong.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I would remember though, its ok for people to want to be left alone though if things are bad, sometimes they just need their space.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Information","I would just say something along the lines of: Hey, youre not acting like yourself today, anything you want to talk about? I would see if there is anything you can do to help, if not just try and be as supportive as you can.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well, youre own health and well being does come first. If you feel it wont get anywhere, give her some space and come back to it at another date if you think you both would be comfortable with it.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds like a solid plan.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions","I am glad i could help! Yeah, everyone including me, forgets that each individual has their own sets of things going on each day. Always good to look at it through their eyes a bit.<|endoftext|>"
Others,It definitely is. I guess thats what makes us human though. Take care!<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",hi. how is your side? Please  how may I be of help.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"everyone says  so, life is in circle,  you just need to keep on pushing.it simultaneously.<|endoftext|>"
Question,do you have any hobby? that you can  use to wipe away time.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I was once in that situation, but what helped me is that, I never give up, though I may be overwhelmed with the challenges and unpalatable situations ..... I keep on pressing it,.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I am a lover of sport, just get use to it,  anytime you are down, take your phone and watch football or basket ball either on YouTube or any other means  .<|endoftext|>"

Others,Hi Keri. How are you today?<|endoftext|>
Information,Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately?<|endoftext|>
Information,"Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Yeah I understand what you're going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I'd say try not to pay any mind to what he's up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass (making yourself happy) then you'll have a much more fulfilling life.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Oh absolutely Keri. Thanks for opening up and sharing your experience and feelings with me for just a few minutes. It was great to talk to you.<|endoftext|>
Others,Happy Holidays Keri. Keep your head up!<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,You saying that your friend does not care about you any more. Is that correct?<|endoftext|>
Others,That's not good. You must be feeling left out.<|endoftext|>
Question,Any particular reason they are doing such thing?<|endoftext|>
Question,"In that case, should you consider them as your friends?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,If someone is not friendly they are not real friend. You need to find someone who will stand by you no matter what..<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Ok.. how about hosting them in your place for a gettogether..<|endoftext|>

"Others,Question",goodness  i am so sorry! my browser did not make a noise. how are you doing? sorry i kept you waiting!<|endoftext|>
Question,"Awww, thanks. How are things going in your world today?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Ah, i hear you. The lack of response makes it really easy for me to make up stories in my head and fear the worst.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I'm sorry. I know the feeling of not knowing where I fit in. Its a whole world shift, too.<|endoftext|>"
Question,That scattered feeling....trying to put the pieces back together....I've walked the same road this year. Would you be willing to mourn for what you had before? To let it go?<|endoftext|>
Question,"you have determination! There is fire within! Tell me, what brings you joy?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,but of course! it was a pleasure to connect. keep chasing joy daily!<|endoftext|>
Others,"oh good, well i got inputs to put!<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"YES! for one, this mturk task is AMAZING  to me. Connection has been a huge boon for me this year. I thrive on helping others realize their strengths.<|endoftext|>"

Others,whenever i can :).<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,You're having problems at work? Does this involve coworkers or is it about your financial situation?<|endoftext|>
Question,I am really sorry to hear that. Is that due to the pandemic? Times are really hard for everyone right now unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can tell from your messages that you are feeling deeply anxious. Are you worried that you might not be able to support your family?<|endoftext|>
Question,"It is a really difficult situation to be in, especially as it's through no fault of your own. Would you consider taking on some part time work for a while?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,There's a big gig economy out there on the internet - you could always try looking there?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,The restrictions are really getting me down as well although I understand why they are necessary. Hopefully the year to come will be better for us all.<|endoftext|>
Others,I hope I am not being patronising by saying that. I know that just because other people feel bad that doesn't mean you automatically have to cheer up :).<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Maybe you could plan something fun to do once this is all over - a mini break perhaps? Gives you something to look forward to.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds like a really great idea! Sometimes even little things can make a big difference to us.<|endoftext|>
Others,Be good to yourself! I hope that I've managed to help a little.<|endoftext|>
Others,Enjoy the rest of your day :).<|endoftext|>
Question,How are you feeling?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I understand. I have been feeling the same way lately -- my family has been distracted and stressed and it's rubbing off on me. Are there other people around that you can spend time with?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I understand. It seems to me that much of what makes the holidays worthwhile is the opportunity to spend time with people we care about. It makes sense that you would have a hard time celebrating with nobody there to share it with you. Are you close with your family these days?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others","(Even if you don't talk to them much, do you think it would be worth reaching out to them?). I see.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you remember enjoying the holidays more when your kids were younger?<|endoftext|>
Question,I see. Do you know what has changed? You said that the teenagers are more interested in getting presents than actually celebrating the holiday itself. Is that a major reason? What about your husband?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I see. You are frustrated with them because of the way they have been behaving. What do you think they should be doing differently? (Also, are you in a state where they have closed down the schools?).<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Oh, that's okay. :).<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Others","Something I tend to struggle with is the way things change over time, when they can never go back to the way they were before. When my sisters and I were little, it seemed like everything in the world was so much simpler, and we had certain Christmas traditions that we always looked forward to, like cutting down a tree, making pumpkin pie, and singing carols and Christmas hymns together. As we've gotten older it seems like our family has gotten split apart a bit more and everyone is too stressed and hurried to enjoy the old things that we used to do. That has been pretty hard for me because things used to be so much different. Has that been difficult for you, as well? Just the fact that things are different now than when your kids were little. I don't have kids, no. I am still a kid, sort of. :). Also I've got a bad cold right now, which is why it's taking me a bit longer to respond as well.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you for talking! Oh, one thing--. Can I write you a Christmas card? If you would rather not give me your name/address, I understand.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Okay. Who should I address it to?<|endoftext|>
Others,"Oh, right. Okay. Good night and Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>"
Question,good. and you?<|endoftext|>
Others,Great. How may I assist you today? Great. How may I assist you today?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Great talking to you too. I am sorry to hear that you are very worried. Why do you think you might lose your class? Are you not good at the subject?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It sounds like it is the problem of the professor. It is always good think about the worst case senario. If, if, you really fail the class, what will happen?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I see! I love your career goal. When I was a student, I visited my professor's room a lot. I did that for almost all classes. Some professors helped me a lot and gave me a lot of hint. Do you visit them as well? I see! I love your career goal. When I was a student, I visited my professor's room a lot. I did that for almost all classes. Some professors helped me a lot and gave me a lot of hint. Do you visit them as well?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can see that you have great passion and you've been making efforts. My school was in a small capital city and the professors were not occupied with other students at all. Since you're good at actual clinical stuff, I think you can do well at the tests too. Maybe you need more time to prepare for the test?<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Affirmation and Reassurance","Those tests are tricky, then I would ask more than a few questions in the class before the test. Students need to know what exactly they need to study in order to pass the test. I don't think most professors will mind helping students prepare for the tests. I am happy to help and I wish your great success in school and in your career.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"anytime, merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"oh, what happened? why are you sad?<|endoftext|>"

Information,that's true. times like these really show us the value of our friends. have you talked to your friends recently? either in person or through phone/video calls?<|endoftext|>
Information,"okay. at lease seeing them in the video should have brought you some relief. Are you planning to get vaccinated when you are able to? And what about your friends? once you are vaccinated, it will help you meet your friends in person.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"oh okay. Have you tried checking with your friends to see if you could meet in person but still maintain social distance and wear masks, etc.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"oh okay, have you discussed anything with your friends to see if you find any alternative way of meeting?<|endoftext|>"

Self-disclosure,oh okay.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, it is the same for most of the people. Any thing particular bothering you?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So, you cannot go out due to COVID and that makes you frustrated. Is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Have you done anything different than usual while staying at home?<|endoftext|>

Reflection of feelings,Let me make sure I understand.  Your feeling stressed about your finals.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I understand what that is like.  What is your biggest fear?<|endoftext|>
Question,Did the teacher provide you with a study guide?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Okay, are you familiar with their testing style?  I am assuming you have had other test in these classes.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I can tell you are stressed, try to relax, are you in a study group?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"They are all probably feeling the same way.  Try not letting fear fail you.  Study hard and be confident, you have made it this far, your almost done.<|endoftext|>"

"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure,Self-disclosure",miscarriages are really hard. I lost a set of twins about 15 years ago. It still makes me sad to wonder what they would be today.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"I have had other children since then, and they make me happy but there will always be a sense of loss. i am sure that is not what you wnat to hear right now but i dont like to lie.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,i actually got a tattoo of a little heart with two halos on my right shoulder to honor thier memory. my miscarriage was my first prgnancy as well. i wonder sometimes if it is just our body saying it wasnt ready yet.<|endoftext|>
Question,are you in a relationship?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information","that is great, i hope he is supportive. you know, it may be a blessing in disguise. with COVID and all the hospitals full, maybe whatever higher power you believe in was saying you are meant to have a healthy baby in a healthy society.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"wow, that is a lot going on at once!<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,you two have time now for you to get healthy and recover and get the house exactly how you want it for a family.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"i had to move into a house a week after having a baby because i went into preterm labor and ended up tearing my stitches. it was a nightmare. i would have loved for my timelime to be differnt, but sometime we have to deal with the hand we are given.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"I remember that. So much blood, it was scary thinking it was all coming out of me.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"well, you have time to get the house ready and when covid restrictions lift get yourself in a moms group so you have support and people to answer questions when they come up! i found a moms group on facebook. They were great to answer pregnancy questions and offer support and suggestions.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","the depression is normal too. you suffered a loss. Your hormones are still out of whack, those take some time to get back to normal. i just searched for the county i live in and moms group. i bet there is one in your area too!<|endoftext|>"

Question,I am doing well. Whats bothering you?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question",Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back.<|endoftext|>
Question,Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,What was the business? It depends on your location but I'm sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose?<|endoftext|>
Information,If you gave her a large amount of money and have any kind of messages about it I would look into trying to get it back.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would seek the advice of a lawyer. I'm sorry this has happened thats horrible.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would say 80K is worth speaking to a lawyer about it. I'm sorry you are so conflicted. I would not call the police because you willingly gave it to her. I would hire a lawyer to handle it.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions,Question,Others","Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. HOw man classes do you have? many *.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Information","That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing. If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject.  Like a chore chart.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!<|endoftext|>
Question,hello how are you ?<|endoftext|>
Question,"can i ask you ,why you can't finish.<|endoftext|>"

Question,I am sorry to hear that. I will help if I can - what is the matter?<|endoftext|>
Question,(Sorry I was afk) I am really sorry to hear that. Can you elaborate a bit? Is it one specific family member or all of them?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others","Is the problem bad enough that you feel you would like to cut them off entirely? I am sorry, I was not trying to intrude :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,"It is a very big decision to make, but in some cases it is the best one.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Is there any possibility of getting professional counselling or something before making the final decision?<|endoftext|>
Others,I am glad you have someone to talk to!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,If a professional thinks that then maybe it really is the best thing to do. It seems unlikely they will change.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That sounds really bad. Making false accusations about people is evil.<|endoftext|>
Others,Okay that sounds really bizarre. I think you truly are better off without them.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,The saying that we can choose our friends but not our family is very true.<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,No worries :). Please try not to fret too much about your problem - to be honest I have some weird family members too.<|endoftext|>

Providing Suggestions,"You still have AIM? Wow, you are really out of date. I hate to say it but maybe she's better off with her ex?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","Sometimes we just have to learn to let go *nods sententiously*. Yeah but, he's got hands and a small nose, right?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I do not know what that is but I can probably spend the rest of my life without finding out and still die happy.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I don't know who those people are either. I live a very sheltered life.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Oh wow, two years is a long time.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure","It sounds like it might not have been the most healthy relationship while it was going on, but it can still really hurt when something like that ends. I went through something similar with an unhealthy relationship that needed to end, but it still hurt for a long time after.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Oh no, being taken by surprise like that can't be pleasant at all.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have friends you can talk to? Spending time with friends can be a good distraction, and give you people to rant to who know you best.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It sounds like you're feeling pretty alone right now.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,You are very mature. Anyone in that situation would feel the same.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"He did a good thing at least, being honest with you. However, cheating, even just once, is something I always warn people.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,"Create your own fun, head to the beach, go to the park,  take a drive to the countryside and enjoy the fall. And of course spending more time in your garden will be a great distraction.<|endoftext|>"

Question,Glad to hear that! Is there some way I can encourage you? :D.<|endoftext|>
Question,"What is the worst part of it for you? Can you identify that? I'll be honest, my husband and I don't even see anyone dying.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Half your neighbors died?<|endoftext|>
Others,So do you think you can identify the most difficult problem you have? Maybe we can look at that and possible find better ways to cope?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I can understand feeling depressed. I think that can be debilitating at times, however there are ways to cope and help you get out of it. I used to struggle a lot with depression, but not much anymore. I learned a lot of coping strategies. I can share a few of those with you if you want. One of the best ways is to take a walk. Get outside, get fresh air. Look at the sky and the clouds and the trees and the grass. This will not only physically refresh you but help your health as well.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Information","As for the pandemic, if you know no one who has died, I wouldn't worry about it. The CDC has no reported deaths of anyone healthy. People who are unhealthy die, not the healthy, and people who are sick ALREADY are the ones who die. If you are relatively healthy, then you are good to go. Do things to protect your health. What are you eating? What are you drinking? Are you talking to friends and getting social life? Are you getting fresh air? Thinking good thoughts?  Or are you living in fear when you are not going to a lot of funerals. It is well documented that our immune system is affected by our mental state, so it is important that you care for your health. Focusing on the negativity of the pandemic will bring you down. Focusing on being healthy and taking care of your mind, soul, spirit and body will help build up your immunity and make you strong.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure,Information","I can understand an ambulance sound is hard to hear, but even that can be turned around. You can pray for the person, then switch your mind off. If you focus on the negative, you will stay negative. If you do what you can (pray) then there is nothing else to do. Focusing on the negative will depress you. One thing I did to help with depression is keep a checklist of things to do when I felt down:  call a friend, call a loved one to encourage THEM, go for a walk, eat fruits and veggies, read a book, go for a bike ride, etc.  Things like that, then I chose to do those things despite how I felt. Doing those things helped my mood TREMENDOUSLY>. Feelings follow thoughts. If you think negative thoughts, you will feel negative. If you think positive thoughts, you will feel positive. Sometimes this takes time, but it works.  Just because you feel sad doesn't mean you should just do nothing, a person can TALK their way out of sadness and choose to do something different.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","I am glad you were able to talk about how this is affecting you. I think many people are affected. And I encourage you to really do things you like and enjoy to keep your mood better. If you feel down, talk about it, pray about it but do NOT dwell on it, because that will bring you down. Sometimes we get in a funk, when we do, we can pull ourselves out, I do suggest you write a list of things to do and put on the frige.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Thank you, how very sweet!  I do thank you for sharing your life with me. I'm an older person and this has affected me too.  Life is full of ups and downs, so I've been through some rough times. You can do this! :D.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others","I had one more thought about when the ambulance comes by and you get upset. Pray for the person, pray for the workers. They are the ones who CAN do something about the sick people. You cannot. You didn't become an ambulance worker. I am not an ambulance worker, I cannot help them either, but I can pray God can help them do their job. Then I let it go. I cannot worry about what is not my job. I have a home and family to care for and pets and neighbors.  So this is what I can do, I cannot fix the sick so the ambulance workers do their job, I do mine. When I try to do their job and worry all about them and the sick people, it's not my job and there will be no peace doing the wrong job. If that makes sense.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"If that is all, then you simply finish the hit. I am sure you will do just fine!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,You are very welcome! Goodbye now and God bless you!<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers. Have you tried any?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I sought out help from a recruiter online who helped me to find a job as well.  Have you heard of that option or tried it?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Yes, I see that you seemed to be more relieved finding out these options. Would you say these suggestions have been helpful?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"From what I've seen, people who can use some of these strategies like deep breathing and counseling they have felt some relief and could move forward better toward their goals.<|endoftext|>"

Question,"I am good, how are you?<|endoftext|>"

Question,I completely understand what you are feeling. Have you tried to talk to your friends about your concerns? It helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have had the same problems in the past with some friends not being there for me when I need it, so I completely understand where you're coming from.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Do you have anyone else to talk to about what you're going through? It also helps a lot of the time to talk to an objective 3rd part to help give you some advice on what they think you should do.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too!<|endoftext|>"

"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",Now is not the time to please your family or anyone else. You did the right and responsible thing for refusing to visit them. May I ask how old your children are?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"they might have been scared because of external forces, as in they might see you being stressed out. I think it's good to talk to them about the seriousness of Covid, but also explain them it's not unpreventable. By discussing, you can reassure yourself too.<|endoftext|>"

Maybe getting your assignments done in time will be helpful for your anxiety. After that, you will have tons of time to spend with friends, family, or simply leisure time to do what you enjoy.<|endoftext|>"
Others,It is a pleasure to help : ).<|endoftext|>
Question,Yeah. I hear that. Around when did these feelings start?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Well i'm really glad to hear that you are reaching out and communicating about it now!<|endoftext|>
"Information,Providing Suggestions","That makes sense. There is a lot of research that look at isolation and mood. Isolation makes things a lot harder. While you are on the road, is there anyone in your support system that you may be able to call?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,You're doing your best for you and your dog! That is great.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,My dog's name is Phineas. He is definitely my best friend.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Do you talk to Garbo? Or bring Garbo to dog parks? That's a great way to do something for both you and Garbo!!<|endoftext|>
Information,Dog parks tend to have a lot of owners who also love dogs. They can love on Garbo and give you some connection too.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,It sounds like Garbo likes the outdoors.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is the weather where you nice enough to take her out?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Ok. My dog, Phineas, love the snow!<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Oh Garbo! Hahahaha! She sounds wonderful!<|endoftext|>
Question,Wow! When was the first time she was sprayed?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Wow! That is almost once a year.<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you think she will do it again? Do you think she will do it again?<|endoftext|>
Information,That is so interesting. Research shows that dogs are color-blind. It must be to contrast!<|endoftext|>
Others,"Right! Good eye, Garbo!<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can you explain to me more in depth what events are making you feel this way?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","I understand exactly how you feel since I am also unable to go fly out to see my family this Christmas. It sounds like you are very overwhelmed with the amount of work you have and having no break, correct?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"When I start to feel alone and missing my family or friends, I usually like the plan a skype or group facetime session right after I get off of work.<|endoftext|>"
Information,There are online resources to have some fun with friends too--many blogs suggest hosting a group game night or a shared movie night.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I am sure with a bit of trial and error, hosting a movie or game night would be a breeze for you too!<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Having this winter sadness, especially around holiday times, may be a sign of seasonal depression.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions","I have had seasonal depression in the past, and going on nature hikes and bike rides has helped me a lot. Maybe spending less time inside your home and grabbing some fresh air can relieve some of that anxiety and stress.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions",Research shows that physical activity greatly reduces stress! It sounds like going out more would be very beneficial to you!<|endoftext|>
Question,Oh I am so sorry. Please know that I am happy to listen! What is going on with you?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Is there no possibility of having your contract renewed?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It could be due to the pandemic, I suppose. Are you in touch with government agencies who could help you due to the exceptional circumstances?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I think a good place to start would be your doctor - they might be able to refer you to a counsellor.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Would you consider taking some sort of job on a temporary basis, even though it is way out of your normal field?  Bar tending or something? Just to make you feel you were earning.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Would you consider medication? It's not a panacea but it can help in the short term.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others",Whatever you do don't go self medicating! That does not help at all. I hope I have been able to give you a little bit of piece of mind and I wish you a good deal of luck in the future.<|endoftext|>
Others,That sounds like a really good idea! All the best.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Anyway thanks for talking :) Can you press the quit button as I am not allowed to my end.<|endoftext|>
Others,Glad to hear :).<|endoftext|>
"Others,Self-disclosure","I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though.<|endoftext|>
Others,Yea it was hard for me too. Thats the thing about change it just happens. I would do something focusing on yourself. Trying to make yourself feel better.<|endoftext|>
Information,Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Good, im glad you can realize that! Some people cant.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Those are great ideas actually, When i want some me time, i usually go for a nice long hike or run.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yeah, it helps i think even down to a chemical level. Kinda like a great reset for our minds.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Great, i just want you to know that your friend moving to a different person is not your fault. Its an unfortunate side of life.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Sorry that typed twice.<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm enjoying hearing the rain on the roof!  Can I encourage you in some way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,You made plans for Christmas and a coworker quit? Are they asking you to work then?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question",I can understand your frustration. You were a team player during Thanksgiving so saying you are not seems like he wants you to feel guilty. Is this a company where you see yourself getting a promotion?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Family is important. I can imagine how excited you have been to see your children again.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I have personally had to learn how to not buy into false guilt.  If you had plans, then they can ask some people to help out. However, I would consider maybe being flexible one day or two, but not out of guilt, but out of concern. I would personally pray about it. It's a hard situation.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","I'm sure it will all work out. I have been in that spot. You want to help, but not because they guilt you into it, that seems unfair. Maybe they will offer double time?  lol That would be nice.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I was just discussing with my husband how many people want to try and intimidate us lately. Seems so many are stressed out. I hope you have a Merry Christmas and really enjoy your visit with the kids.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I agree with you!  It has been a tough year. Jobs come and go, but family is forever! :D.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Thanks! :D.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Great, I am happy to lend a listening ear.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Of course, what is bothering you today?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Are you worried of losing your job due to COVID-19?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I understand your concern about losing your job during these times. So many people are worried and it doesn't seem to be getting better.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you tried speaking to your employer about how you can secure your job? Many people have been trying to see if they can get unemployment just in case they do lose their income.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It is always good to know all your options during the pandemic. I hope you feel better assured knowing that you can try and qualify for unemployment benefits just in case you do lose your job.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything else you would like to share with me?<|endoftext|>
Others,Please end the conversation if there is nothing left for me to help you with :).<|endoftext|>
Others,Happy to work with you :).<|endoftext|>
Question,I am working today.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Information",Different jobs have different policies so you could check into that. I do know people who have had to do that. I would caqll and talk to my boss about how I was feeling and see if there is a solution.<|endoftext|>
Information,You have a direct supervisor or a human resource person that you could talk to at the company. They should be able to answer those questions for you.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I'm sorry you are depressed. What's going on?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Sometimes it can help to just talk about things and get it off your chest.<|endoftext|>
Question,Why do you feel that way? Could it be the people your surrounded by making you feel that way?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I think everyone's off this holiday season. It's not a normal christmas.You're not alone in feeling this way.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Has anyone specific made you feel this way? I would hope your family doesn't make you feel that your depression ruins Christmas that's horrible.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think you need to surround yourself with more understanding people.<|endoftext|>
Others,It can be challenging but there are understanding people out there. You can't always pick your family. But if they truly make you feel that way you aren't obligated to be there. That's horrible.<|endoftext|>
Others,"I have struggled my whole life on and off. Learning triggers and ways to cope with them is very important. A positive mindset doesn't cute depression by any means, but it will help in accepting ways to cope.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome:) I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and can surround yourself with positivity. Wish you all the best.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello there, how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I hear you .. it can be very difficult dealing with other peoples' problems all day. Would you consider retraining for something else?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,True. So you feel you're stuck in a rut - you're not happy but you don't feel unhappy enough to move on?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,It's a vicious cycle isn't it!? What about looking for another profession that does not involve much retraining?<|endoftext|>
Question,"Are you in a financial position where you could take some time off, go travelling perhaps, and renew yourself?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Well, I would hope that they would understand that even therapists have to have a private life. And I am sure they'd prefer you at the peak of your game and not burned out.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Yes perhaps you could switch to part time? If you could afford it?<|endoftext|>
Others,Somewhere at the top of the chain there must a very weary therapist with no-one to talk to. Though I suppose that is where these bots come in :D.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions","lol. It's an interesting mental picture. I am glad you still have a sense of humour though. Yeah - try  and take up a new hobby with the extra time, maybe?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I am sorry to hear that. On another note, have you considered speakign to your GP? Perhaps medication might help.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I have tried medication and I found it surprisingly helpful but everyone is different of course. There was no impairment though.<|endoftext|>
Others,Yes  you do! Thank you for talking and you take care of yourself!<|endoftext|>
Others,I am glad to hear it :) Goodbye!<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others","Whats been going on? Oh no, that's not good.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Ain't that the truth.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","I'm sure it isn't, how long had you been together? California is beautiful I know, but it can also be pretty quick paced.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Are you still working?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",It's important that you know that you can feel whatever way you need to about your loss. Its a tough time of year for something like that. Had things been pretty rocky?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question","Wow, that's horrible. It seems you should have some kind of legal authority in that aspect. Is that a big problem out there?<|endoftext|>"
Others,It is important that you understand that it seems that she has been thinking of this for a while.<|endoftext|>
Question,Does she have family there?<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you spoken with her since she left?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,That's mid-boggling..<|endoftext|>
Others,Do you have any hobbies?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Well, I can't make her come back, but I can provide you with some information on how to get through these tough times.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions","I understand, it can be good to help get some stress out in other ways. Do you excercise? What kind of hobbies do you have?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I like to run every morning, and it seems to help make alot of stress evaporate.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I have found for me anyway, that running is an amazing stress reliever.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question",Hi. how are you? how it's going on?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,why are you feeling in that way? tell me what it's happening?<|endoftext|>
"Others,Question",oh my god! I'm so sorry for that. why do you failed your exam? did you study and prepared well?<|endoftext|>
Question,What happen with your dog? it was sick?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,He or she were with you for a long time. you should remember him/her many times per day:( I know how are you feeling now.<|endoftext|>
Question,are you there?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I can help you!<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am so sorry to hear that. You have probably become very attached after that long, I can imagine.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can I ask why you have to give him up? Do you have any other pets?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,You are a very good caretaker for your parrot. You have given him a lot of specialized care.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,You have been the best you could be for him and it has got to feel really sad to let him go. It can feel like a death sometimes when you lose someone or a pet.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I understand a little bit of how you feel. My dog died recently and it was really hard when the vet had to put him down. I was really sad and would cry when I thought of him ort the things we used to do together.<|endoftext|>
Others,Would you ever consider getting a pet that is not as loud? I am not suggesting that you replace him.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I am concerned that if you don't have a pet to care for you may have a more difficult time to recover and thrive. Mourning is a process and it might be easier if you can hare your ;love with another pet.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,A seeing eye dog is a great idea. You are trying to think of ways to help yourself and that is really important. You are also reaching out and sharing your feelings. Do you have any friends with pets that you can visit with from time to time?<|endoftext|>
Information,I am sorry that makes a lot of sense. I am really thankful that you are sharing your feelings and expressing them.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Rescue centers usually make people apply to adopt to insure a good home for them. You have made him into a wonderful pet.<|endoftext|>
Information,You are welcome. You are doing what is right and i am proud of you for listening to your heart and providing the best all these years. Thank you for your time today and please come back whenever you need to talk. I am happy to listen and do my best.<|endoftext|>
Question,Absolutely. Tell me more about it. When did it happen?<|endoftext|>
Question,I see. Were you living with your boyfriend? How was your life post breakup?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I am sorry to hear that. It must be difficult. I have gone through a lot of breakups in my life too, and I  know what you are going through.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Has the sadness eased over time in the past year? Were you consciously taking some measures to get over the stage?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"On average it takes me about a year to get over this. I feel like there is no better person for me, I don't know what the future brings, and I am imaging all the scenarios where past relationships could have been successful for me. I took a lot of walks and spent a lot of time with friends.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others",I didn't. I wasn't able to afford them. I actually felt bad about venting the situation to my friends. They offered a lot of emotional support and I am sure they didn't want to seeing me like this. Do you have a support system in place? Are you considering getting counseling?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I am glad that you are preemptive about it. I think one year in, if you still constantly think about it, a counseling session would help you get closure. Even if it is a one session, you can always assess after trying this out. My current company actually offers free counseling session if I want to, I understand it is called ""One Medical""?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I also took up a lot of volunteering. It gives me a purpose and a group to belong to, where I can start fresh, have no baggages and meet new people.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I am not familiar with the dating situation in pandemic time. I would say take it slow. If it is a right partner for you, it will make you a better person.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I am glad that we are able to chat. I hope things can start working out for you and you are able to move on to a new chapter of life.<|endoftext|>
Others,Thank you. You too. I wish you all the best.<|endoftext|>
Others,Hello.<|endoftext|>
Others,I am doing well and how are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure","Thank you for sharing, feeling anxious days before an exam is a normal. I am also anxious about my upcoming exam this week.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question",I am preparing to sit to become a clinical counselor. I can relate to feeling anxious. You are not alone. What do you think is triggering your anxiety?<|endoftext|>
Information,"Research has shown that fear of failure does stem from feelings of anxiety, but is it possible to look at fear of failure from a different perspective?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you think you can channel your fear of failure into positive energy?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others","You can turn your anxiety into extra energy to plan and prepare. Having anxiety can give you a boost of energy, which gives you an advantage to achieve your goal.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, indeed. Having anxiety will keep you anchored to your study plan which would increase your ability to perform well for the exam.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Awesome! In addition, as you follow your study plan, remember to pace yourself.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"You are welcome, I hope this session was helpful.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Hello how is your day going.<|endoftext|>
Question,Im sorry to hear that please tell me about it.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I understand that can be flustering. Have you tried contacting your school for help?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It is hard to let your coworkers down but you could be honest with them and tell them what happened .<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Information",One thing you need to assure yourself of is that it wasnt your fault. You do have some other methods available to you to get the transcripts.<|endoftext|>
Question,Have you tried contacting your State or county board of education?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,The good news is your coworkers will always look up to you even if you are not in the supervisor roll. Your coworkers look up to you because of the person you are.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Providing Suggestions",You can still be a big influence to your coworkers without being in the supervisor roll. I think if you spent some time being a mentor to some of your coworkers you would feel better about the situation.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Your coworkers obviously look up to you and would appreciate your leadership in mentoring.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Information",Take this oppertunity to share your experience with your coworkers and reach out to your management for more training that is available to you. Perhaps you can take some online classes on your own and show management that you are taking an interest in advancing in the company.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Your welcome I'm glad I was able to help.  Is there anything else I can help you with?<|endoftext|>
Others,OK goodbye.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,It sound like you are having a really hard time right now.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That is a very difficult situation. Starting over again can be a great opportunity for growth.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I understand how you feel. I had a bad break up, but it turned out to be a good thing in the long run.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Restatement or Paraphrasing","Well, looking back the relationship was pretty toxic and everything was better once I was out of it. I am sure your life will be happier and more fulfilling soon. It sounds like you are blaming yourself for everything. Why do you feel at fault?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It sounds to me like you have been working hard to support your life with you partner. They should respect that.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is this a relationship you would want back if you could get it back?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I would agree with you on that! That was how I felt too.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Others","For sure. Just take things slowly, one day at a time. Take the time you need to learn to enjoy your new life. For sure. Just take things slowly, one day at a time. Take the time you need to learn to enjoy your new life. Sorry for hitting enter twice. :).<|endoftext|>"
Others,You're welcome! I'll be rooting for you!<|endoftext|>
Question,I am good thank you. Is there anything you want to talk to me about?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"So your relationship ended and you feel that you are struggling to get over it, is that correct?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I am very sorry. I have been through something like this myself in the past so I do understand.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I think it was at least a year before I felt truly myself again and that I was able to enjoy life.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I can tell that it's all very raw to you at the moment. You really need to step away and give yourself some time to heal.<|endoftext|>
Question,What sort of obligations do you feel that you have? You need to be kind to yourself at the moment.<|endoftext|>
Question,"It is good of you to be so caring and responsible towards your family. Do you think that perhaps you are taking too much on yourself though, especially at such a difficult time?<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question",I think that that is an excellent idea and that you are being very mature about this. Are you in contact with your ex at all?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,That seems sensible. I had a problem with not contacting my ex when we split. I kept wanting to talk to him again even though I knew that I should not.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,A restraining order :D.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"In all seriousness though, with hindsight I realise that our separation was for the best. I think and hope that you will realise this in time too.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Providing Suggestions",You are most welcome. I really hope that things start to go well with you soon. Might I suggest taking up a new hobby and making some new friends?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",I'm sorry to hear you are sad. What's going on? Maybe I can encourage you? Ouch! So he wants to see his ex? Basically he is breaking up with you? How long did you date him?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I'm so sorry to hear this. You must be full of all kinds of emotions now. What are your plans?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I can understand your frustration. It happened to me before. And I've had girlfriends. They never change. They will apologize because they got caught, but they never really change.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,It's going to be very painful for a while because you have been invested 3 years in this relationship. Do you have friends to talk to that can encourage and support you?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Reflection of feelings","I find if they flirt, they already have cheated. Loyalty is something inside a person, or not. Very few will look inside themselves and see why they do this and want to change. If you were married, you would need counseling. Do you meet up with your exes?<|endoftext|>"
Others,He lied because he didn't want you to know the truth. Which is betrayal.<|endoftext|>
Others,"It's a hot mess, is it not? Why did you feel you wanted to spy on him? Did you already mistrust him?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Question","Ok, so this is a HUGE red flag to you. You can ignore it, or not. Women KNOW when a man is cheating, so you had that inside of you. And you went with your hunch and now you have found he is dishonest. Was the photoshoot to have pictures of him?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I suppose it could be Christmas pictures of him for you? Or not. I personally feel honesty is the best policy, no matter what. I would come clean. I would tell him I sensed trouble and looked for it and found it.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You could be, but then you wouldn't have a feeling of mistrust, you would just be sensing a surprise.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"He could say that. And if he is lying, do you think he will begin to be honest? You will have to judge for yourself. If he is lying, he will continue to lie. And you will feel it inside of yourself. Is this the first time you felt this way? Or has this happened before?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"I'm an older woman, almost 60. I've been married 20 years but I had a lot of boyfriends and I can tell you one thing, If they start to look elsewhere, run for the hills, they will continue to excuse their behavior, apologize, say they will change, and it just gets worse. I drove myself insane with worry, suspicion. I wanted someone to treasure me, not cheat and lie. Cheaters don't change their spots.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Can you tell me a little more about your situation so I can better understand?<|endoftext|>
Information,"It sounds like your friend's husband might be jealous of your daughter, or embarrassed.that his daughter did not get moved up also. Have you spoken to your friend about this?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,It depends on the depth of the relationship between the three of you. How long have you all been friends?<|endoftext|>
Information,"Yes, that is a difficult situation to know how to handle. It could be in your best interest to leave your friend out of it so she doesn't feel stuck in the middle or forced to take sides. However she could view the opposite as you going behind her back.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. Perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions.<|endoftext|>"
Others,That is exactly right. Each person handles and avoids conflict differently and you have the important roll as leader in all of this. There is a chance he is not aware of the strain this has put on you emotionally and he could respond well to not being called out by someone else. Does that make sense?<|endoftext|>
Question,"I can understand how you would feel like he doesn't care about the strain it's placed. Can I ask, are your daughters aware or involved in these rumor's? This could make a difference in how you could respond.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Sounds like your daughter has a good head on her shoulders. Maybe there's something to be learned from her reaction to all of this. I understand how hard this has been for you so perhaps simply ignoring the rumors will allow you to heal quicker, by simply being the bigger person. Because rumors are just rumors, after all. You and your daughter know the truth and that's all that matters.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"If he knows you know and you rise above with a smile on your face, that could show him that you are more mature than his childish games, and that you mean business. By taking ownership of your own feelings and emotions, you might find that will squash your need to let out any anger towards him.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Exactly. Let his problems remain his. You worry about you and your daughter and he can watch from a distance confused at his failed attempt to reflect his own dissatisfaction with life onto you didn't work. I think you will feel freed.of any stress this has caused.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything you’d like to talk about?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Wow, you’ve lost friends. I know how that feels. So you’re missing them?<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance",I honestly believe we all go through that. I think it’s especially difficult with divorce.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question",Friends are so important to me also. Do you thing the covid crisis has caused more divorces?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It’s certainly more difficult to make new friends now.<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Question","Wow, that’s difficult. You’re married?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I sure miss my friends.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"That’s wonderful, I am closer to my spouse now also.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Have you considered new activities, like hobbies?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,I learned how to how to.bake sourdough bread for instance.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"One other thing, many insurance companies are providing chat via computer with counseling.<|endoftext|>"
Question,Do you lost your job because of pandemic.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,yeah that's a bad situation it seems.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,"I will also add, that being a Manager means you have some very important skills that would translate well to your next job, or anything you decide to do.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Also, let's say you decided to work for another company, something new, outside of retail. Because you were a manager, you could also be promoted more quickly because of your management experience.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Yes, it sounds like a part of you still misses the retail environment. I see that too. My best advice, is take a few days to think about what you really want to do.  Think about what you are skilled at. Then decide which route you want to go.  I know there will be numerous options out there for you in retail management, but if you wanted to do something different, there will be opportunities there too. Because you have options, you will likely pick the choice that will be most fulfilling for you, in something you will be passionate about - so this will likely be very positive for you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"that's possible. but you will have plenty of options either way. Could be a different retail store, or something new.<|endoftext|>"

Providing Suggestions,That's a great start. The quality of your profile is important. Did you ask anyone to give you feedback on your profile?<|endoftext|>

Question,What sort of position and in what industry?<|endoftext|>
Information,That sounds like a competitive profile under normal circumstances.<|endoftext|>

Question,I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about it?<|endoftext|>
"Question,Affirmation and Reassurance","COVID has really changed a lot of stuff. I understand your frustration. Has your work increased because of COVID conditions. Meaning you have to take extra work, or doing tasks that you dislike to do? If you don't feel comfortable elaborating, we can always talk about how you feel and how you can maybe feel a bit better.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Reflection of feelings","That sounds really bad. I once worked in a company that placed unnecessary pressure on me, with a low pay. I can relate to how you feel. Do you have to depend on this company for work? Sometimes it's really not worth working somewhere if it's really affecting your mental health.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance,Others","I understand. But I want you to think about this. Your mental health is more important right now because it is affecting you. And how you feel really affects those around you, especially the ones who love you. If you take some time to think about what is more important to you in life right now can help you make a decision. Working so hard can be a barrier right now. But you may have a bright future plan ahead. If so, that is something you want to look forward to. I know what you are doing is really helping your family. And I know they really appreciate it, even if they don't say it.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Ok, I understand better now. Thank you for explaining. What you are telling should to be something you need to discuss with your partner. Do both of you communicate well with each other? Maybe he is not aware of your situation or how you feel.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question","Oh no. I can see from his part he feels upset and frustrated because he may feel useless at the moment. But that's not an excuse to neglect responsibilities. You can maybe make him feel more useful around the house by starting to assign him small tasks. Encouraging him to do stuff and rewarding him with words of encouragement. I know it sounds kind of frustrating to do that, but maybe this small step on your half could also help him. Do you have any family member that are close to you? If your partner isn't helpful, maybe seeking help from family can reduce your housework load.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Affirmation and Reassurance","I'm sorry if this did not help the situation. But I'm always glad to listen if you want to talk more. It's a really tough situation, but you're a really strong individual. You've made it this far : ).<|endoftext|>"
Others,No problem. I really wish you the best and I hope everything works out! Crossing my fingers COVID ends soon.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"First of all, you can bring some snacks and water. having an empty stomach will distract you from the exam.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I have been in that situation many times. From my own experience, yes you should review as much as you can. However, relax the last 2-3 days to not overwhelm yourself. You should also do image training, imagine yourself in the test room, plan ahead what you will do like write your name, open the exam booklet...<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"It takes alot to grow into that kind of person, I'm not there yet. I find it vital to understand this, you cannot control everything. As long as you try your best, whatever the outcomes are, they all serve a purpose. When one door closes, the others will open.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"You are right, I also want to be in control of my life. However, as I grow older, I realize that is impossible. Whenever you feel stressed over life issues, I would recommend taking a walk in the park or anywhere with a lot of trees to clear you mind.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Question","sounds like a great plan, i believe you will do well. Is there anything I can help you with?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Buy some alcohol wipe, you can find it at the grocery store, make sure to come in early enough to do that.<|endoftext|>"
Others,I believe they sell individual packs of 10 wipes too.Good lick with your exam!~.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I would love to do that, I like talking with people and listen to their stories.<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Hello :).<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So it sounds like you feel like you don't measure up to your co-works because they are getting different results than you?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Information",I would completely agree with that statement you are much newer than your co-workers. I believe you that you are very committed to your job.

Providing Suggestions,Of course! With time you will get the hang of it. Well thats good to hear! Maybe you could ask one of them to coffee and express how you are feeling. I would bet that they felt the same when they started.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,That certainly is something I can relate. There was a period of time in school where i signed up for way too many classes and had to drop out of a few. If you feel like you are in over your head it is ok to take a step back. It is important that you take care of your self and know your limits. :).<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I would say if you are showing signs for several weeks of being overwhelmed (tired, stressed, snappy etc.) That is probably is too much.<|endoftext|>"

Question,I am sorry to hear that. How often do you have problems sleeping?<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Question","I hear you, I used to have noisy neighbours too. How long have you been living next to your noisy neighbours for?<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions,Others","If noise levels are above the legal limit, you can get the police involved, however, its probably better to have that open conversation with them first. Let them have the opportunity to fix it before it escalates. Have you tried just a simple knock on the wall to let them know you are not happy? Since they are not answering the door.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"I would personally try to write a letter and post it through their door, give them 24 hours to be able to read it and think about it.If they continue to be noisy the next day, you should definitely call the police. The police are there for law and order, and it sounds as though they are causing a public nuisance which is what the police are there to do, no matter how troublesome your neighbours are. They aren't above the law.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"I understand you feel helpless, but I really think that is the last option. I don't know if you are saying the police will not help because this is what you have been told by a friend or this is your experience. But they really are there to help you in a case like this.<|endoftext|>"
Information,"""Police typically are responsible for maintaining public order and safety, enforcing the law, and preventing, detecting, and investigating criminal activities. These functions are known as policing"".<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance","Then I would suggest if the police are not able to help you take the officers badge numbers and contact your local council or government,. No problem. I know your issue will be solved without having a move away. Have a great day too!<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,So your work load is giving you stress and you cannot change your job. Right?<|endoftext|>

Self-disclosure,I can understand your situation very well as it happened with me in past. In this scenario you should take small breaks to relax your body and mind. You will feel better.<|endoftext|>
Others,Time is running bad for all of us. We have to take care of our health at this time. Stress can lead to so many disease and it will be hard to afford that extra burden in terms of time and money.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, you should keep looking for it with your current job. There is no harm in being prepared.<|endoftext|>"
Others,You should consult a doctor for that. You can try yoga or meditation if you can take little time for yourself.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,You should try to give bit time to yourself. Try to talk to friends and family over the weekend. All these things always work for me.<|endoftext|>
Others,That's true ! Still you can go and relax in your backyard with family or talk to them on phone. We will feel good.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,I am glad they make you get tested and you feel safe. That is the most important thing.<|endoftext|>
Question,That sounds like an amazing job!<|endoftext|>
Question,Is the job good only temporarily? Like do you aim to keep this job or is it only a holiday job?<|endoftext|>
Question,How would you approach asking the manager if your job is in danger if you were to do that?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Well, I remember once being unsure of my job. I approached my manager and with all professionalism, I asked if there was any way I can do more for the work. That helped me at the time. I never specifically asked if my job was in danger, though.<|endoftext|>"
Others,"Yeah, exactly.<|endoftext|>"

Affirmation and Reassurance,"Unfortunately, this is such an isolating time and losing some of that contact is going to be an adjustment. I can completely understand that.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,I can definitely relate to that. The amount of anxiety this has all caused is more than I could've ever imagined. The important thing is that we reach out and talk about things in order to help reset and deal with what's going on.<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Restatement or Paraphrasing","We'll get through it.  You seem motivated to find a new job which is half the battle.

Providing Suggestions,im so sorry to hear of this issue. do you have other outlets like getting out into nature? i find a good walk or a nice book helps with easing my mind.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Others","i could see why that may worry you. as it would worry me also. as my parents are older in age and i have young children. i just realize that life must go on regardless of given situation. always look to the positive. it is best to find something to ease your mind rather it be facetiming family, reading, yoga, or even getting fresh air. hows the weather where you are located?<|endoftext|>"

Reflection of feelings,That's is good to know you are doing ok. Did you do anything for the holidays?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Yeah, it is pretty frustrating with the shutdowns. I was pretty nervous for today and how I would be able to see family. Are you close to your family?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Wow, that is far! Thankfully you were able to video chat them. Do you plan on video chatting with them today? Wow, that is far! Thankfully you were able to video chat them. Do you plan on video chatting with them today?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,That is good! It seems like calling on the phone can feel more genuine. Do you like playing Among Us? It might be fun to teach them how to play a game that allows you to play from far away. That is good! It seems like calling on the phone can feel more genuine. Do you like playing Among Us? It might be fun to teach them how to play a game that allows you to play from far away.<|endoftext|>
Others,I believe we have to each do 10 chat bubbles.<|endoftext|>
Question,Is there anything else you want to talk about?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","I like to set mini goals for myself to make long term goals attainable. For example, I am in college and if I have to write a 8 page paper, I push myself to write at least 1 page every day until I finish. Then I have enough time to edit and make the deadline. Another suggestion is to remind yourself why you need to wake up and get things going! For me, I know I want to help others in the future but without the degree I am going for, I would not be able to help.<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Yeah, bills are such a big responsibility. Hopefully this task will help some. Were you a part of theater productions?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Those are such amazing paths. I believe the stand up comedy could be done through podcasting. I hope you have a good night.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hello there, how are you?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"I'm very sorry to hear that, did something not go as planned recently?<|endoftext|>"
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Providing Suggestions","Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal. But funnily enough, the imagination of an idealist that lets them visualize great things can also create equally strong fears before getting answers. And thankfully those fears can be addressed outside of the head where they're made. Have you tried reaching out to these friends  yourself and initiating your own plan with them since this group chat?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Right, it can seem a bit confusing since you naturally would expect to feel comfortable with so much between each other already.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Information","On the contrary, I think you might not be allowing yourself to ask enough! Sometimes, the people who are closest to us can actually become even more anxious about how something might affect your feelings. It could be the case with him too.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,Some people express themselves best through their actions. Have you tried suggesting a meeting for something you'd usually do to see if they're willing to hang out just as always?<|endoftext|>
Question,How has life been going for you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,I its been quite tough for us all with the Covid 19 chaos.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,You dont have friends or company that comes to visit? I know going through tough times can have you feeling alone.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I am doing what I love to do most which is helping others because it makes me feel better to help others if I can.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I have something to look forward to everyday I can help someone vent about things they feel that they are unable to say out of fear of being judged or frowned upon or as you might say is rough about your life.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,finding what make one happy can be a big job. you stay positive and you are sure to get positive results!<|endoftext|>
Others,you are very welcome.<|endoftext|>
Others,you have a good night as well.<|endoftext|>

Restatement or Paraphrasing,sounds hard. are you doing anything to help.<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,that's a good idea. Have you thought about disconnecting?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,nothing better than the outdoors wit h some friends. Fresh air can really clear the mind.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,perspective is found from looking at things from a distance. you maybe to close to everything right now to see the forest from the trees.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Again, I think you were the mature one that ended the relationship. It is hard to see her ""move on"", but you will do the same. covid has changed the environments to meet people though, and all I can suggest is to be patient. The world will get back to normal. and you will too.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,no problem. stay safe.<|endoftext|>
"Question,Others",I'm doing ok I'm glad you are good. Is it snowing by you? Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
Question,How can I help you today?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,I hear you are having trouble figuring out which friends are really your friends and which ones aren't. Is that about right?<|endoftext|>

Question,Is this a significant other?<|endoftext|>
Question,Are they ignoring you?<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,That's no good what do you think the problem is?<|endoftext|>
Question,Do you owe someone already?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Reflection of feelings","That can get in the way of a friendship sometimes, but I try not to get ahead of myself and  jump the gun. They may have lost a phone or something may have come up... That very well could be... Are you working?<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"I see, Have you tried for unemployment?<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Question",I understand that. What if that is the case? You may need to talk to them and let them know how you feel about that. How long has this been going on?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"I understand that, but if you want to get to a point that you feel better about it then you will have to speak to them.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Restatement or Paraphrasing","Do you see them everyday? I understand that, are you able to go over there.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Well I can see that you have put the effort in to try and keep the relationship so it sounds like the ball is in their court if they want to do the same.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Well that is about all that can be done and wait for them to come around...Do you have  any hobbies?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Question",I like to go on runs every morning. It helps to clear my mind and makes it easier to brush things off when they bother me. What instrument do you play?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"It is a really good stress reliever. I played when I  was younger, didn't ever get very good. Did you?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"Hmm, well maybe take some more lessons, We can always strive to be better at everything we do.<|endoftext|>"
"Providing Suggestions,Others",Maybe take a run in order to clear your mind. I'm sure they will come around.<|endoftext|>
Others,That may be a good idea. Good talk.<|endoftext|>
Question,to them and may find out that it was never anything against you.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",I sometimes get ahead of myself and try to figure out what is going on and thinking that it was something I did. You are right too. COVID has stressed everyone out to the max. It has been a crazy year I am glad that it is almost over.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I'm sure it will. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<|endoftext|>
Others,"No problem, I hope everything works out for you and your friends. Have a great New Year!<|endoftext|>"
Others,Good day!<|endoftext|>
Question,why do you think that?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question","so, you hate people and they hate you back. if you hate people why would you care if they hated you back.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Self-disclosure",it can atake time for people to change. if you change yourself if can take a while for others tosee the change and for them to adjust thier thoughts. pushing people away leads tounhappiness and misery. i did it for years.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,a fresh start would be agreat way to do that.<|endoftext|>
Question,any idea where you would go?<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Self-disclosure,Self-disclosure,Self-disclosure","i did not know that, i am in school for my master's degree. i taught myself to read in kindergarden i am told lol. from what i have seem going through college though, i completely beleive it. from what i have seem going through college though, i completely beleive it. warm is nice. i used to live in florida.<|endoftext|>"

Restatement or Paraphrasing,it can be frusterating i get it. good luck!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard.<|endoftext|>
Question,Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods?<|endoftext|>
Question,Yeah great minds think alike.. do you do anything else for work?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,"Okay, you know I'm here for you. Talk to me, what's happening?<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,"The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over?<|endoftext|>"
Question,"That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things?<|endoftext|>"
Information,"Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"When you try to fix things, just remember that this is his method. I wouldn't hold back on what you have to say, but just word it so that he doesn't feel the need to flee.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"It is HIS responsibility as a parent to want to fix things, but you are also being the bigger person here. I applaud you and hope that he is receptive.<|endoftext|>"
Others,How did you guys leave it?<|endoftext|>

Question,why are you feeling sad?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,oh hate is such a strong word for your friend to use.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,oh that is quite a pile of conflict on you. you must be feeling emotionally.overwhelmed.<|endoftext|>
"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Question",the boyfriend could very well be the reason she is lashing out at you. maybe she is projecting her feelings toward her boyfriend onto you. has she had problems with her boyfriend in the past.<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"you're feeling a bit like a punching bag because she has chosen such strong words without a reason, right?<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Others",has she ever spoken to u in this way before? or similarly.<|endoftext|>
Information,"A lot of times, people lash out in times when they are feeling stressed and the people closest to them can end up getting the brunt of it.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"maybe you should let her know that you love her and say that you would never want to hurt her, so if you've hurt her, you'd like to know what you've done so you can avoid doing it in the future.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,but you have to make it clear that you cannot accept that kind of disrespect in the future if she can not come up with a reason for why she said it.<|endoftext|>
Others,absolutely.<|endoftext|>
Question,I am here to listen and help all that I can. Do you have a specific problem you're worried about?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,Thank you for sharing with me today and it sounds like this has happened organically. You seem surprised and that makes a lot of sense.<|endoftext|>
Others,You seem to have a close bond and have been through sobriety together. That can make you feel very close to someone. How is your relationship with your husband?<|endoftext|>
Others,Could you be transferring feelings because she has been there for you through a rough time and maybe you feel understood more than you do in your marriage? Can you talk to your wife about your feelings openly?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I am sorry to hear that. I was also married at one time and had similar issues. We never could get passed some issued like having kids or not. I understand it can be difficult coming to terms with someone. It doesn't always work out.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,That makes a lot of sense and good for you. That's an awesome testament to your hard work.Does your mentor feel the same way about you?<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,Do you have  sense that she has deeper feelings for you and that might be what you are picking up on and contributing to your feelings?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you considered getting a mentor who you don't have strong feelings for and slowing down your friendship?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,I can understand. Have you ever consider starting a journal. A place to write your deepest secrets?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,You need to put yourself first and distance is important. Sometimes writing your feelings down can make them practical in nature. You may read back what you write and learn about how you feel in a deeper way. Maybe you will learn you are craving attention from your wife and not getting it and that is contributing to this dilemma.<|endoftext|>
Information,Thank you for sharing and please reach out anytime. Have a great day.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Hello, I am doing well. How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>"

Others,You are doing great I believe and really trying hard to do your schoolwork right.<|endoftext|>
Question,Why do you think that might be?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"I would try to have a regular to set a goal for each day by stating to yourself today is a new day, remain focus on the task at hand, try not to worry about all tasks at once, and lastly try to find a relaxing sleep schedule that fits your needs.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yes, It will be hard at first because you are not use to it, but once you get started your life will be so much more relaxing. Your stress level will become more less than what is was before. Also, You will be able to have a clearer mind to concentrate on your schoolwork more by having this new schedule.<|endoftext|>"

"Restatement or Paraphrasing,Affirmation and Reassurance,Restatement or Paraphrasing","One year is quite a while.  You should know each other's pet peeves by now.  can you explain some examples of reason why you fight. Birds of a feather flock together meaning that fighting with each other does not work and never will.   I want to know what you fight about to see if it is silly or not. Can you give me a few ""silly"" examples?  I wont be embarrassed.  As long as he is not physical abusive most things can be worked out due to communication.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Try and find food that you both enjoy and compromise.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"say he wants pizza and you want chinese, say well you know what lets get a burger so neither of us win or loses.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,Tell him that if he wants his food he needs to leave you alone.  you need to sit down and have a serious talk with him. listen to me.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,go to a table and comfortable table and stare at him straight in the eye.  Tell him your concerns that you are fighting too much and that it is ruining your love and relationship.  STARE INTO HIS EYES and see what he says.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"If he is evasive, the eyes are the windows into the soul.  Make him promise you that you will stop fighting or else you are going to find another man who will appreciate you.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,it's called the take-away in psychological sales.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,of course it will.<|endoftext|>

Affirmation and Reassurance,Then you sit down and have a serious talk and do what I say and see what happens. EYES ARE KEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,good luck sweety.<|endoftext|>
Question,"Hi there, how are you feeling today?<|endoftext|>"
Question,Are you wanting to get back to work?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Well yes I can concur with that. I have often found work takes my mind off my problems.<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Well that's not a phrase that I much like. But there's nothing wrong with liking your job.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"It's okay :) I did not realise that it predated Hitler. On another note, tell me about your job?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Well, a lot of people have been made redundant due to the pandemic - but that is not a reason why people should be happy with a dead end job. Would you consider something else?<|endoftext|>"
Question,It's okay to coast for a while if it's paying the bills but in the long term it won't be very satisfying. What would be your chances of retraining?<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,What about a whole new career though? Something you'd never even considered before?<|endoftext|>
Others,I know but think about how worth it it would be! Did you have anything you wanted to do as a child that you never did?<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,Could it possibly be some sort of mid life crisis? I am forty five and frankly am starting to question everything in my life.<|endoftext|>
"Self-disclosure,Providing Suggestions",heh it does creep up on you trust me :D. On that note thank you for talking and have a lovely day!<|endoftext|>
Question,Ah that can be a very difficult age. Is it anything specific or just general?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,Well ... to be honest it doesn't sound very terrible. Most children that age do things like that ;).<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Well, it is a bit anti social but there are a lot of worse things she could be doing :) I was pretty slobby at that age too.<|endoftext|>"
Self-disclosure,Ah that's a bad combination. I hear you on the menopause thing. Do you think maybe it is making you more touchy? It is me!<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Have you thought of offering rewards if she smartens up a bit?<|endoftext|>
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Self-disclosure",I think that once she hits puberty she will probably change her feelings about showering etc a lot :). Teenagers tend to get very very involved in their appearance :D I used to spend an hour in the shower each day.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,Perhaps you could gently explain to her why it's anti social to not shower for a week?<|endoftext|>
Others,Ah you have all the fun of her teenage years to look forward to. I would not go through that again :D.<|endoftext|>
"Others,Providing Suggestions",Well that is definitely something!! Maybe try to help her take pride in her appearance? Give her some make up lessons?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,I think that's pretty normal for a tweenage girl :) She's probably starting to be interested in make up and things.<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,I don't either to be honest but a lot of young girls are interested in it.<|endoftext|>
Question,Are her friends a good influence on her/.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe you could treat her to a new haircut, give her a new pride in herself?<|endoftext|>"
Others,Oh of course I had forgotten about the pandemic. It seems ages since we had normal life!<|endoftext|>
Others,Well I hope I have been able to be of help and it has been nice to talk to you!<|endoftext|>
Others,Heh I promise you are not :).<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Thanks for talking! (can you press quit first, I can't do it from my end :)).<|endoftext|>"
Others,have a nice rest of day :).<|endoftext|>
Question,i see. are your parents paying for your university?<|endoftext|>
Restatement or Paraphrasing,oh i see. so you mean that your parents would prefer you to choose the path that will eventually give you a higher salary?<|endoftext|>
Affirmation and Reassurance,"that is a tough situation. it's definitely not easy to go against your family's wishes, but at the same time you have to do what's best for you.<|endoftext|>"
"Self-disclosure,Information","i went through a similar experience during my schooling, and i had to explain to my parents that i don't want to disappoint them but i still have to do what makes me happy. having a career that you hate doesn't feel good - i've been there. but there can be careers in engineering that have connections to architecture as well, such as structural engineering.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Information,Providing Suggestions","honestly i think both are great career paths to pursue and as you said, both are stable and well-paying fields. strengths doesn't always equal happiness though, so that's a tough one. have you considered speaking with both architects and engineers to learn more about each job? that might be helpful in your decision. sometimes what we think a job does, in actuality can be totally different in real life.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,ah well i commend you on taking that step and actually trying to learn about the jobs. you seem like a really smart person and you're able to see things from a logical perspective.<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Self-disclosure","i think what you need to do is take that same logical approach and explain calmly to your parents the path you want to take. just because they think your strengths are suited for architecture, doesnt mean you don't also have the strengths for engineering. many of the same skills are probably required for both jobs, and you're right: ultimately it is about what will make you happy. and worst case scenario: you can always change careers later if you find that you don't like what you're doing.<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"you sound like a good student and i'm sure your parents must recognize that you're capable of great things, so if you can present to them a logical argument of why you feel engineering is a better path, hopefully they will listen.<|endoftext|>"
Others,you're welcome. best of luck to you and i hope you find the right path for yourself. i commend you for opening up here and i think you'll find success.<|endoftext|>
Others,thanks!<|endoftext|>
Question,I'm sorry to hear that. What about it is making you anxious?<|endoftext|>
"Reflection of feelings,Question","That definitely would make someone anxious. Do you want advice, or would you just like me to be here for you?<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Of course. It might help to do something that relaxes you: listening to music, or maybe talking to a friend.<|endoftext|>"
Providing Suggestions,"Maybe, you can practice some self affirmation too! If you studied and paid attention, you know you can do your best on the test.<|endoftext|>"
"Information,Affirmation and Reassurance","Sometimes, when you've done all you can do, it helps to rewind. You sound like a good student, I know you'll do your best.<|endoftext|>"
"Reflection of feelings,Others","I know it can be frustrating when we don't do well, but that's ok. Of course! If you're done talking, feel free to end the session.<|endoftext|>"
"Others,Affirmation and Reassurance","Okay, whenever you're ready. I know you'll try very hard! Relax so you can do your best.<|endoftext|>"
Information,I agree. It can stress you out more when you're already stressed.<|endoftext|>
"Information,Affirmation and Reassurance","Yes, people do better on tests when they are well rested. It sounds like you're on the right track! Keep it up.<|endoftext|>"
Others,Have a nice day/night/evening!<|endoftext|>
Reflection of feelings,"Hey there, how are you doing/.<|endoftext|>"
Question,"Sorry, i could not see the description of the problem. Could you please paste it again?<|endoftext|>"
Reflection of feelings,"oh, i am so sorry.<|endoftext|>"
"Question,Others",Did you try to message him to see if he can chat with you? so that you get a chance to understand what made him break up with you? or do you have a common friend that can help arrange a meetup ?<|endoftext|>
"Providing Suggestions,Affirmation and Reassurance",Hmm. do you want to give him some time to maybe cool off and then try to get in touch with him again? i know you are anxious but sometimes it is best for time to heal things and bring things back to normal.<|endoftext|>
Providing Suggestions,"Do you have any other friend that you can lean for a little bit for support? this will help you get out of anxiety. Maybe, try to get busy with work or spend time on your hobbies. it helps to take your mind off of this thing a bit and will make you a bit less anxious.<|endoftext|>"
"Affirmation and Reassurance,Providing Suggestions","That's good. at least you found ways to get out of the anxiety. and social media can cause anxiety too, so staying from your phone also helps :).<|endoftext|>"
Affirmation and Reassurance,"Yeah. given enough time and when things cool off, people do dwell on their behaviour and often times feel stupid for the way they act. i hope its the same case with your boyfriend as well. I have a feeling he is going to give you a call soon.<|endoftext|>"
Others,you bet :).<|endoftext|>
Self-disclosure,"Nice. i am glad, i could be of some help.<|endoftext|>"
